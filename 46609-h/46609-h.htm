<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE</h2>


<p>One of the most delightful of the <i>Last Essays of Elia</i> is
entitled 'Detached Thoughts on Books and Reading',
a title which would serve very well to indicate the contents
of this anthology. In bringing together into one volume
the tributes and opinions of a galaxy of writers, my object
has been the glorification of books as books, a book being
regarded as a real and separate entity, and often as an end
in itself. There is a wide circle to whom this collection
should appeal, in addition to bibliomaniacs or mere collectors
of first or rare editions to whom the contents are often
anathema, for the love of books is not confined to scholars
or great readers. This love is incommunicable: it comes,
but happily seldom goes, as the wind which bloweth where
it listeth; it is perfectly sincere, and knows nothing of
conventions and sham admirations.</p>

<p>No greater lover of books has ever lived than that Englishman
who was born at Bury St. Edmunds seven hundred
and thirty years ago&mdash;Richard de Bury, Bishop of Durham,
author of <i>Philobiblon</i>, and, as Lord Campbell said, undoubtedly
the founder of the order of book-lovers in England.
Centuries passed, and then the more modern worship of
books was promoted by one of even higher station than
this lord chancellor and lord high treasurer of England&mdash;by
King James, whom sycophants and cynics called the
British Solomon. The sixteenth century saw also the births<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
of Bacon, Burton, and Florio, the inspired translator of
Montaigne, and Ben Jonson, who all deserved well of the
order. Milton, with prose and poetry, handed down the
sacred fire in the seventeenth century, and his</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">soul was like a Star, and dwelt apart.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Dr. Johnson, nearly a hundred years later, filled a niche of
his own, irreverent though he was to books except for their
message. The latter half of the eighteenth century is
especially memorable, for it synchronized with the early
years of Southey, Lamb, and Leigh Hunt, the very temples
of the spirit which I have sought to enshrine in these pages,
and of Hazlitt, and of two who should be dear to librarians,
Crabbe and John Foster. I should like to claim an honoured
place in the nineteenth century for Bulwer Lytton, who,
although he understood 'the merits of a spotless shirt',
understood books also and appreciated them thoroughly;
and for the Brownings, especially the author of <i>Aurora
Leigh</i>. Emerson is conspicuous, not only as a book-lover,
but also as a professor of books, and as a missionary in
the sense that Carlyle and Ruskin preached the gospel
of books. Many others deserve honourable mention, but
I must pass on to some of those who adorn the present
day. It would have been very pleasant to have seen
Lord Morley, Mr. Frederic Harrison, Mr. Austin Dobson,
Mr. Edmund Gosse, Mr. Andrew Lang, and Mr. Augustine
Birrell appearing in this cloud of witness, but happily they
are alive to testify to the faith that is in them, and for that
reason are beyond the scope of an anthology confined to
authors who are dead.</p>

<p>It may be pointed out that there has been an increasing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span>
tendency to write not so much about books as about the
authors of books; but to have included literary criticism,
except incidentally, would have increased this volume to
prodigious size. While I have been obliged for the same
reason to ignore, as a rule, individual volumes, an exception
has been made of the Bible, which is itself a library, and
this is justified by the fact that many pages are devoted
to libraries. Scores of poems have been prefixed to volumes
or addressed in apology to possible readers, but these, and
colophons, interesting though they may be, do not fit in
with my scheme. However tempting it seemed to give
versions of Catullus, Horace, or Martial, translations from
ancient classic writers have been excluded; but room has
been found for classic writers of comparatively modern
times, for it would have been ridiculous to have passed over,
for example, Montaigne, whose immortal essays have been
handed down in the splendid English dress of John Florio's
design. For the rest, the contents of this volume, in which
more than 200 authors bear their varying testimony, must
speak for themselves.</p>

<p>The passages will be found grouped more or less according
to subjects, though the dividing lines are fine, and chronological
order within the limits of the groups has been
a secondary consideration. After forewords by Lamb, the
anthology deals with books as companions, the love of and
delight in books, the immortality of books and the immortality
which they convey, the multiplicity of books and the
distraction of choice; ancient and modern books and their
respective claims; books that are or may be thought
injurious; novels and romances; bookmaking of various
kinds&mdash;plagiarism, books about books, anthologies, abridge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>ments,
dedications, presentation copies, bibliographies,
translations, and quotations; books and preachers, and
books as 'the true university of these days'; critics
and criticism; rules for reading, commonplace-books,
abstracts, epitomes, and marginalia; casual and superficial
reading, talking from books, brains turned by books, over-reading;
books and life; books as an enemy to health and
as pharmaceutical preparations for mental indisposition;
reading in bed, at meal-times, and out-of-doors, and the call
of the book of nature; the horn-book and other books for
children; advice on youthful reading, and the early preferences
of some notable book-lovers; love and literature,
and the conflict between matrimony and the library;
women and books and libraries; the human species of
book-worms, bibliomaniacs, and pedants; the proper
handling of books; bindings, book illustrations, &amp;c.; book
pests&mdash;worms and moths; 'finds' at second-hand bookshops
and what Leigh Hunt calls 'bookstall urbanity';
booksellers and publishers; mammon and books; book
borrowers and book borrowing; bookish similes; books
for magic; the Bible; literary geography; libraries&mdash;as
studies and keys to character, private libraries real and
imaginary, public libraries&mdash;from the provincial reference
library to the British Museum, reflections in libraries,
Crabbe's masterpiece, the libraries of Oxford and Cambridge
with fitting tributes to Bodley; and, finally, a memorable
tribute to books and the priceless treasury that a library
affords. The source of the quotations is generally given;
and the index of authors quoted or referred to, together
with a full list of contents, and, it is hoped, the notes, should
serve the convenience of the reader.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span></p>

<p>Many years ago Mr. Alexander Ireland gave me a copy of
<i>The Book-Lover's Enchiridion</i>, and my debt to that 'treasury
of thoughts on the Solace and Companionship of Books'
is great. Mr. Ireland's object was 'to present, in chronological
order, a selection of the best thoughts of the greatest
and wisest minds on the subject of Books&mdash;their solace
and companionship&mdash;their efficacy as silent teachers and
guides&mdash;and the comfort, as of a living presence, which they
afford amidst the changes of fortune and the accidents of
life.' In this volume I have taken the subject and myself
less seriously than would have been possible to Mr. Ireland.
The 'thoughts' which I have collected are more 'detached',
and they cover a wider field. I am under much obligation
also to the <i>Ballads of Books</i>, which Mr. Brander Matthews
compiled nearly a quarter of a century ago and Mr. Andrew
Lang recast, and to Mr. W. Roberts's <i>Book-Verse</i>. Mainly,
however, I have relied upon my own personal reading&mdash;'blessing,'
as Lamb said, 'my stars for a taste so catholic,
so unexcluding'&mdash;and upon research, in which I have
had invaluable assistance from friends and colleagues.
I am fortunately able to include many copyright pieces,
and I have to thank the following for the necessary permission:&mdash;</p>

<p>Messrs. G. Bell &amp; Sons, Ltd., for B. W. Procter's autobiographical
fragment, 'My Books'; Messrs. Chapman &amp; Hall,
for what I have taken from a contribution to the <i>Fortnightly
Review</i> by Mark Pattison, and for the passage from Carlyle's
<i>Historical Sketches</i>; Messrs. Chatto &amp; Windus, for the
poems by Laman Blanchard, also for the passage from
R. Jefferies' <i>Life of the Fields</i>; and Messrs. Macmillan &amp; Co.,
for the excerpt from the same author's <i>The Dewy Morn</i>;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>
Messrs. Constable &amp; Co., and the executors of the late George
Gissing, for the passages from <i>The Private Papers of Henry
Ryecroft</i>; Mr. A. C. Fifield, for Samuel Butler's whimsical
irreverence quoted from <i>Quis Desiderio</i>; Mr. Edward
Garnett, for Richard Garnett's poem; the Houghton
Mifflin Co., for Whittier's 'The Library'; Messrs. Longmans,
Green &amp; Co., for R. L. Stevenson's 'Picture Books
in Winter' (and Messrs. Charles Scribner's Sons in respect
of copyright in America); Mr. Elkin Mathews, for Lionel
Johnson's poem; Messrs. G. Routledge &amp; Sons, Ltd., for
Longfellow's 'My Books', and 'Bayard Taylor' (and the
Houghton Mifflin Co. in respect of copyright in America);
Messrs. Smith, Elder &amp; Co., for J. A. Symonds's poem from
<i>Lyrics of Life</i>; and Dr. A. Stoddart Walker, for permission
to quote from J. S. Blackie's <i>Self-Culture</i>.</p>

<p>In <i>Guesses at Truth</i> the brothers Hare wrote: 'They who
cannot weave a uniform net, may at least produce a piece
of patchwork, which may be useful, and not without
a charm of its own.' It is my modest ambition that
book-lovers shall find this volume useful and not without
charm.</p>

<h3>GRACE BEFORE BOOKS</h3>

<p>I own that I am disposed to say grace upon twenty other
occasions in the course of the day besides my dinner. I want
a form for setting out upon a pleasant walk, for a moonlight
ramble, for a friendly meeting, or a solved problem. Why
have we none for books, those spiritual repasts&mdash;a grace
before Milton&mdash;a grace before Shakespeare&mdash;a devotional
exercise proper to be said before reading the <i>Fairy Queen</i>?&mdash;but,
the received ritual having prescribed these forms to
the solitary ceremony of manducation, I shall confine my
observations to the experience which I have had of the
grace, properly so called; commending my new scheme
for extension to a niche in the grand philosophical, poetical,
and perchance in part heretical liturgy, now compiling by
my friend Homo Humanus, for the use of a certain snug
congregation of Utopian Rabelaesian Christians, no matter
where assembled.&mdash;<span class="smcap">C. Lamb.</span> <i>Grace before Meat.</i></p>


<h3>THE DELIGHTFUL SOCIETY OF BOOKS</h3>

<p>These friends of mine regard the pleasures of the world
as the supreme good; they do not comprehend that it is
possible to renounce these pleasures. They are ignorant
of my resources. I have friends whose society is delightful
to me; they are persons of all countries and of all ages;
distinguished in war, in council, and in letters; easy to
live with, always at my command. They come at my call,
and return when I desire them: they are never out of
humour, and they answer all my questions with readiness.
Some present in review before me the events of past ages;
others reveal to me the secrets of Nature: these teach me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
how to live, and those how to die: these dispel my melancholy
by their mirth, and amuse me by their sallies of
wit: and some there are who prepare my soul to suffer
everything, to desire nothing, and to become thoroughly
acquainted with itself. In a word, they open a door to all
the arts and sciences. As a reward for such great services,
they require only a corner of my little house, where they
may be safely sheltered from the depredations of their
enemies. In fine, I carry them with me into the fields, the
silence of which suits them better than the business and
tumults of cities.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Petrarch.</span> <i>Life</i> by S. Dodson.</p>


<h3>THE CONTENTMENT I HAVE IN MY BOOKS</h3>

<p>Here is the best solitary company in the world: and in
this particular chiefly excelling any other, that in my study
I am sure to converse with none but wise men; but abroad
it is impossible for me to avoid the society of fools. What
an advantage have I by this good fellowship that, besides
the help which I receive from hence, in reference to my life
after this life, I can enjoy the life of so many ages before
I lived!&mdash;that I can be acquainted with the passages of
three or four thousand years ago, as if they were the weekly
occurrences! Here, without travelling so far as Endor,
I can call up the ablest spirits of those times; the learnedest
philosophers, the wisest counsellors, the greatest generals,
and make them serviceable to me. I can make bold with
the best jewels they have in their treasury, with the same
freedom that the Israelites borrowed of the Egyptians, and,
without suspicion of felony, make use of them as mine own.
I can here, without trespassing, go into their vineyards,
and not only eat my fill of their grapes for my pleasure,
but put up as much as I will in my vessel, and store it up
for my profit and advantage.</p>

<p>How doth this prospect at once set off the goodness of
God to me, and discover mine own weakness? His goodness
in providing these helps for the improvement of mine
understanding; and my weakness in needing them. What
a pitiful, simple creature am I, that cannot live to any
purpose, without the help of so many other men's brains!
Lord, let this be the first lesson that I learn from these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
silent counsellors, to know my own ignorance: other
knowledge puffeth up, this edifieth.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Sir W. Waller.</span>
<i>Divine Meditations.</i></p>


<h3>HE THAT LOVETH A BOOK WILL NEVER WANT</h3>

<p>The calling of a scholar ... fitteth a man for all conditions
and fortunes; so that he can enjoy prosperity with moderation,
and sustain adversity with comfort: he that loveth
a book will never want a faithful friend, a wholesome
counsellor, a cheerful companion, an effectual comforter....
The reading of books, what is it but conversing with the
wisest men of all ages and all countries, who thereby communicate
to us their most deliberate thoughts, choicest
notions, and best inventions, couched in good expression,
and digested in exact method? The perusal of history,
how pleasant illumination of mind, how useful direction of
life, how spritely incentives to virtue doth it afford! How
doth it supply the room of experience, and furnish us with
prudence at the expense of others, informing us about the
ways of action, and the consequences thereof by examples,
without our own danger or trouble!&mdash;<span class="smcap">I. Barrow.</span> <i>Of
Industry in our Particular Calling as Scholars.</i></p>


<h3>THE COMPANY OF MUTES</h3>

<p>I often derive a peculiar satisfaction in conversing with
the ancient and modern dead,&mdash;who yet live and speak
excellently in their works.&mdash;My neighbours think me <i>often
alone</i>,&mdash;and yet at such times I am in company with more
than five hundred mutes&mdash;each of whom, at my pleasure,
communicates his ideas to me by dumb signs&mdash;quite as
intelligibly as any person living can do by uttering of
words.&mdash;They always keep the distance from me which
I direct,&mdash;and, with a motion of my hand, I can bring them
as near to me as I please.&mdash;I lay hands on fifty of them
sometimes in an evening, and handle them as I like;&mdash;they
never complain of ill-usage,&mdash;and, when dismissed from my
presence&mdash;though ever so abruptly&mdash;take no offence. Such
convenience is not to be enjoyed&mdash;nor such liberty to be
taken&mdash;with the living.&mdash;<span class="smcap">L. Sterne.</span> <i>Letters.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>


<h3>A CONSOLATION FOR THE DEAF</h3>

<p>I read with more pleasure than ever; perhaps, because
it is the only pleasure I have left. For, since I am struck
out of living company by my deafness, I have recourse to
the dead, whom alone I can hear; and I have assigned them
their stated hours of audience. Solid <i>folios</i> are the people
of business, with whom I converse in the morning. <i>Quartos</i>
are the easier mixed company, with whom I sit after dinner;
and I pass my evenings in the light, and often frivolous,
<i>chit-chat</i> of small <i>octavos</i> and <i>duodecimos</i>.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Lord Chesterfield.</span></p>


<h3>SWEET UNREPROACHING COMPANIONS</h3>

<p>I armed her [Olivia] against the censure of the world,
showed her that books were sweet unreproaching companions
to the miserable, and that if they could not bring
us to enjoy life, they would at least teach us to endure it.&mdash;<span class="smcap">O.

<h3>A HEAVENLY DELIGHT</h3>

<p>Talk of the happiness of getting a great prize in the
lottery! What is that to the opening a box of books!
The joy upon lifting up the cover must be something like
what we shall feel when Peter the Porter opens the door
upstairs, and says, Please to walk in, sir. That I shall never
be paid for my labour according to the current value of
time and labour, is tolerably certain; but if any one should
offer me £10,000 to forgo that labour, I should bid him
and his money go to the devil, for twice the sum could not
purchase me half the enjoyment. It will be a great delight
to me in the next world, to take a fly and visit these old
worthies, who are my only society here, and to tell them
what excellent company I found them here at the lakes of
Cumberland, two centuries after they had been dead and
turned to dust. In plain truth, I exist more among the dead
than the living, and think more about them, and, perhaps,
feel more about them.&mdash;<span class="smcap">R. Southey</span> (Letter to S. T.
Coleridge).</p>


<h3>THE BEST OF ALL POSSIBLE COMPANY</h3>

<p>Coleridge is gone to Devonshire, and I was going to
say I am alone, but that the sight of Shakespeare, and
Spenser, and Milton, and the Bible, on my table, and
Castanheda, and Barros, and Osorio at my elbow, tell me
I am in the best of all possible company.&mdash;<span class="smcap">R. Southey</span>

<h3>THE FELLOWSHIP OF BOOKS</h3>

<p>What were days without such fellowship? We were
alone in the world without it. Nor does our faith falter
though the secret we search for and do not find in them
will not commit itself to literature, still we take up the
new issue with the old expectation, and again and again, as
we try our friends after many failures at conversation,
believing this visit will be the favoured hour and all will be
told us....</p>

<p>One must be rich in thought and character to owe nothing
to books, though preparation is necessary to profitable
reading; and the less reading is better than more;&mdash;book-struck
men are of all readers least wise, however knowing
or learned.&mdash;<span class="smcap">A. B. Alcott.</span> <i>Tablets.</i></p>


<h3>A COMPANY OF THE WISEST AND THE WITTIEST</h3>

<p>There are books which are of that importance in a man's
private experience, as to verify for him the fables of Cornelius
Agrippa, of Michael Scott, or of the old Orpheus of
Thrace,&mdash;books which take rank in our life with parents
and lovers and passionate experiences, so medicinal, so
stringent, so revolutionary, so authoritative,&mdash;books which
are the work and the proof of faculties so comprehensive,
so nearly equal to the world which they paint, that, though
one shuts them with meaner ones, he feels his exclusion
from them to accuse his way of living.</p>

<p>Consider what you have in the smallest chosen library.
A company of the wisest and wittiest men that could be
picked out of all civil countries, in a thousand years, have
set in best order the results of their learning and wisdom.
The men themselves were hid and inaccessible, solitary,
impatient of interruption, fenced by etiquette; but the
thought which they did not uncover to their bosom friend
is here written out in transparent words to us, the strangers
of another age.&mdash;<span class="smcap">R. W. Emerson.</span> <i>Books.</i><br /><br /></p>


<p>We should choose our books as we would our companions,
for their sterling and intrinsic merit.&mdash;<span class="smcap">C. C. Colton.</span> <i>Lacon.</i></p>

<h3>TRUE FRIENDS THAT CHEER</h3>

<p>It is a beautiful incident in the story of Mr. Roscoe's
misfortunes, and one which cannot fail to interest the
studious mind, that the parting with his books seems to
have touched upon his tenderest feelings, and to have been
the only circumstance that could provoke the notice of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
Muse. The scholar only knows how dear these silent, yet
eloquent, companions of pure thoughts and innocent hours
become in the season of adversity. When all that is worldly
turns to dross around us, these only retain their steady
value. When friends grow cold, and the converse of
intimates languishes into vapid civility and commonplace,
these only continue the unaltered countenance of happier
days, and cheer us with that true friendship which never
deceived hope nor deserted sorrow.&mdash;<span class="smcap">W. Irving.</span> <i>The

<h3>THE TRUE ELYSIAN FIELDS</h3>

<p>In my garden I spend my days; in my library I spend
my nights. My interests are divided between my geraniums
and my books. With the flower I am in the present; with
the book I am in the past. I go into my library, and all
history unrolls before me. I breathe morning air of the
world while the scent of Eden's roses yet lingered in it,
while it vibrated only to the world's first brood of nightingales,
and to the laugh of Eve. I see the pyramids building;
I hear the shoutings of the armies of Alexander; I feel
the ground shake beneath the march of Cambyses. I sit
as in a theatre,&mdash;the stage is time, the play is the play of
the world. What a spectacle it is! What kingly pomp,
what processions file past, what cities burn to heaven,
what crowds of captives are dragged at the chariot-wheels
of conquerors! I hiss or cry 'Bravo' when the great
actors come on shaking the stage. I am a Roman Emperor
when I look at a Roman coin. I lift Homer, and I shout
with Achilles in the trenches. The silence of the unpeopled
Syrian plains, the out-comings and in-goings of the patriarchs,
Abraham and Ishmael, Isaac in the fields at eventide,
Rebekah at the well, Jacob's guile, Esau's face
reddened by desert sun-heat, Joseph's splendid funeral
procession&mdash;all these things I find within the boards of my
Old Testament. What a silence in those old books as of
a half-peopled world&mdash;what bleating of flocks&mdash;what green
pastoral rest&mdash;what indubitable human existence! Across
brawling centuries of blood and war, I hear the bleating
of Abraham's flocks, the tinkling of the bells of Rebekah's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
camels. O men and women, so far separated, yet so near,
so strange, yet so well-known, by what miraculous power
do I know ye all! Books are the true Elysian fields where
the spirits of the dead converse, and into these fields
a mortal may venture unappalled. What king's court can
boast such company? What school of philosophy such
wisdom? The wit of the ancient world is glancing and
flashing there. There is Pan's pipe, there are the songs of
Apollo. Seated in my library at night, and looking on the
silent faces of my books, I am occasionally visited by
a strange sense of the supernatural. They are not collections
of printed pages, they are ghosts. I take one down
and it speaks with me in a tongue not now heard on earth,
and of men and things of which it alone possesses knowledge.
I call myself a solitary, but sometimes I think
I misapply the term. No man sees more company than
I do. I travel with mightier cohorts around me than ever
did Timour or Genghis Khan on their fiery marches. I am
a sovereign in my library, but it is the dead, not the living,
that attend my levees.&mdash;<span class="smcap">A. Smith.</span> <i>Dreamthorp.</i></p>

<h3>THE DESIRABLE TABERNACLE</h3>

<p>O celestial gift of divine liberality, descending from the
Father of light to raise up the rational soul even to heaven!...
Undoubtedly, indeed, thou hast placed thy desirable
tabernacle in books, where the Most High, the Light of light,
the Book of Life, hath established thee. Here then all who
ask receive, all who seek find thee, to those who knock thou
openest quickly. In books cherubim expand their wings,
that the soul of the student may ascend and look around
from pole to pole, from the rising to the setting sun, from
the north and from the sea. In them the most high incomprehensible
God Himself is contained and worshipped....</p>

<p>Let us consider how great a commodity of doctrine exists
in books, how easily, how secretly, how safely they expose
the nakedness of human ignorance without putting it to
shame. These are the masters who instruct us without rods
and ferules, without hard words and anger, without clothes
or money. If you approach them, they are not asleep; if
investigating you interrogate them, they conceal nothing; if
you mistake them, they never grumble; if you are ignorant,
they cannot laugh at you.&mdash;<span class="smcap">R. de Bury.</span> <i>Philobiblon.</i></p>

<h3>THE LEGACIES OF GENIUS</h3>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i20">Quod nec Iovis ira, nec ignis,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nec poterit ferrum, nec edax abolere vetustas.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ovid.</span><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Aristotle tells us, that the world is a copy or transcript
of those ideas which are in the mind of the first Being, and
that those ideas which are in the mind of man are a transcript
of the world. To this we may add, that words are
the transcript of those ideas which are in the mind of man,
and that writing or printing is the transcript of words. As
the Supreme Being has expressed, and as it were printed,
his ideas in the creation, men express their ideas in books,
which, by this great invention of these latter ages, may last
as long as the sun and moon, and perish only in the general
wreck of nature. Thus Cowley, in his poem on the Resurrection,
mentioning the destruction of the universe, has
these admirable lines:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">Now all the wide extended sky,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And all the harmonious worlds on high<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And Virgil's sacred work shall die.<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>
<p>There is no other method of fixing those thoughts which
arise and disappear in the mind of man, and transmitting
them to the last periods of time; no other method of giving
a permanency to our ideas, and preserving the knowledge
of any particular person, when his body is mixed with the
common mass of matter, and his soul retired into the world
of spirits. Books are the legacies that a great genius
leaves to mankind, which are delivered down from generation
to generation, as presents to the posterity of those
who are yet unborn.&mdash;<span class="smcap">J. Addison.</span> <i>Spectator</i>, 166.</p>

<h3>THE DEPOSITARY OF EVERYTHING HONOURABLE</h3>

<p>Books are the depositary of everything that is most
honourable to man. Literature, taken in all its bearings,
forms the grand line of demarcation between the human
and the animal kingdoms. He that loves reading has
everything within his reach. He has but to desire; and
he may possess himself of every species of wisdom to judge
and power to perform....</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>
<p>Books gratify and excite our curiosity in innumerable
ways. They force us to reflect. They hurry us from point
to point. They present direct ideas of various kinds, and
they suggest indirect ones. In a well-written book we are
presented with the maturest reflections, or the happiest
flights, of a mind of uncommon excellence. It is impossible
that we can be much accustomed to such companions,
without attaining some resemblance of them. When I read
Thomson, I become Thomson; when I read Milton, I become
Milton. I find myself a sort of intellectual chameleon,
assuming the colour of the substances on which I rest.
He that revels in a well-chosen library has innumerable
dishes, and all of admirable flavour. His taste is rendered
so acute, as easily to distinguish the nicest shades of
difference. His mind becomes ductile, susceptible to every
impression, and gaining new refinement from them all.
His varieties of thinking baffle calculation, and his powers,
whether of reason or fancy, become eminently vigorous.&mdash;<span class="smcap">W.
Godwin.</span> <i>The Inquirer: Of an Early Taste for Reading.</i></p>


<h3>LOVE THAT IS LARGE</h3>

<p>There is a period of modern times, at which the love of
books appears to have been of a more decided nature than
at either of these&mdash;I mean the age just before and after the
Reformation, or rather all that period when book-writing
was confined to the learned languages. Erasmus is the
god of it. Bacon, a mighty book-man, saw, among his
other sights, the great advantage of loosening the vernacular
tongue, and wrote both Latin and English. I allow this
is the greatest closeted age of books; of old scholars sitting
in dusty studies; of heaps of 'illustrious obscure', rendering
themselves more illustrious and more obscure by
retreating from the 'thorny queaches' of Dutch and
German names into the 'vacant interlunar caves' of
appellations latinized or translated. I think I see all their
volumes now, filling the shelves of a dozen German convents.
The authors are bearded men, sitting in old wood-cuts,
in caps and gowns, and their books are dedicated to
princes and statesmen, as illustrious as themselves. My
old friend Wierus, who wrote a thick book, <i>De Praestigiis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
Daemonum</i>, was one of them, and had a fancy worthy of
his sedentary stomach. I will confess, once for all, that
I have a liking for them all. It is my link with the bibliomaniacs,
whom I admit into our relationship, because my
love is large and my family pride nothing. But still I take
my idea of books read with a gusto, of companions for bed
and board, from the two ages beforementioned. The other
is of too book-worm a description. There must be both
a judgement and a fervour; a discrimination and a boyish
eagerness; and (with all due humility) something of
a point of contact between authors worth reading and the
reader. How can I take Juvenal into the fields, or Valcarenghius
<i>De Aortae Aneurismate</i> to bed with me? How
could I expect to walk before the face of nature with the
one; to tire my elbow properly with the other, before I put
out my candle and turn round deliciously on the right side?
Or how could I stick up <i>Coke upon Littleton</i> against something
on the dinner-table, and be divided between a fresh
paragraph and a mouthful of salad?&mdash;<span class="smcap">J. H. Leigh Hunt.</span>
<i>My Books.</i></p>


<h3>A CATHOLIC TASTE IN BOOKS</h3>

<p>To mind the inside of a book is to entertain one's self with the forced
product of another man's brain. Now I think a man of quality and
breeding may be much amused with the natural sprouts of his own.
<i>Lord Foppington in 'The Relapse'.</i>
</p>

<p>An ingenious acquaintance of my own was so much
struck with this bright sally of his Lordship, that he has
left off reading altogether, to the great improvement of his
originality. At the hazard of losing some credit on this
head, I must confess that I dedicate no inconsiderable
portion of my time to other people's thoughts. I dream
away my life in others' speculations. I love to lose myself
in other men's minds. When I am not walking, I am
reading; I cannot sit and think. Books think for me.</p>

<p>I have no repugnances. Shaftesbury is not too genteel
for me, nor Jonathan Wild too low. I can read any thing
which I call a <i>book</i>. There are things in that shape which
I cannot allow for such.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>In this catalogue of <i>books which are no books</i>&mdash;<i>biblia
a-biblia</i>&mdash;I reckon Court Calendars, Directories, Pocket
Books, Draught Boards bound and lettered at the back,
Scientific Treatises, Almanacks, Statutes at Large; the
works of Hume, Gibbon, Robertson, Beattie, Soame
Jenyns, and, generally, all those volumes which 'no gentleman's
library should be without'; the Histories of Flavius
Josephus (that learned Jew), and Paley's <i>Moral Philosophy</i>.
With these exceptions, I can read almost any thing. I bless
my stars for a taste so catholic, so unexcluding.</p>

<p>I confess that it moves my spleen to see these <i>things
in books' clothing</i> perched upon shelves, like false saints,
usurpers of true shrines, intruders into the sanctuary,
thrusting out the legitimate occupants. To reach down
a well-bound semblance of a volume, and hope it is some
kind-hearted play-book, then, opening what 'seem its
leaves', to come bolt upon a withering Population Essay.
To expect a Steele, or a Farquhar, and find&mdash;Adam Smith.
To view a well-arranged assortment of blockheaded Encyclopaedias
(Anglicanas or Metropolitanas) set out in an
array of Russia, or Morocco, when a tithe of that good
leather would comfortably re-clothe my shivering folios;
would renovate Paracelsus himself, and enable old Raymund
Lully to look like himself again in the world. I never
see these impostors but I long to strip them, to warm my
ragged veterans in their spoils.&mdash;<span class="smcap">C. Lamb.</span> <i>Detached
Thoughts on Books and Reading.</i></p>


<h3>A SENSE OF HUMOUR</h3>

<p>I am not prepared to back Charles Lamb's Index Expurgatorius.
It is difficult, almost impossible, to find the book
from which something either valuable or amusing may not
be found, if the proper alembic be applied. I know books
that are curious, and really amusing, from their excessive
badness. If you want to find precisely how a thing ought
not to be said, you take one of them down and make it
perform the service of the intoxicated Spartan slave. There
are some volumes in which, at a chance opening, you are
certain to find a mere platitude delivered in the most superb
and amazing climax of big words, and others in which you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
have a like happy facility in finding every proposition stated
with its stern forward, as sailors say, or in some other
grotesque mismanagement of composition. There are no
better farces on or off the stage than when two or three
congenial spirits ransack books of this kind, and compete
with each other in taking fun out of them.&mdash;<span class="smcap">J. H. Burton.</span>
<i>The Book-Hunter.</i></p>


<h3>BOOKS THE TRUE LEVELLERS</h3>

<p>It is chiefly through books that we enjoy intercourse
with superior minds, and these invaluable means of communication
are in the reach of all. In the best books great
men talk to us, give us their most precious thoughts, and
pour their souls into ours. God be thanked for books!
They are the voices of the distant and the dead, and make
us heirs of the spiritual life of past ages. Books are the
true levellers. They give to all, who will faithfully use
them, the society, the spiritual presence, of the best and
greatest of our race. No matter how poor I am. No
matter though the prosperous of my own time will not
enter my obscure dwelling. If the Sacred Writers will
enter and take up their abode under my roof, if Milton
will cross my threshold to sing to me of Paradise, and
Shakespeare to open to me the worlds of imagination and
the workings of the human heart, and Franklin to enrich
me with his practical wisdom, I shall not pine for want of
intellectual companionship, and I may become a cultivated
man, though excluded from what is called the best society
in the place where I live.</p>

<p>To make this means of culture effectual a man must
select good books, such as have been written by right-minded
and strong-minded men, real thinkers, who instead
of diluting by repetition what others say, have something
to say for themselves, and write to give relief to full, earnest
souls; and these works must not be skimmed over for
amusement, but read with fixed attention and a reverential
love of truth. In selecting books we may be aided much by
those who have studied more than ourselves. But, after all,
it is best to be determined in this particular a good deal by
our own tastes.&mdash;<span class="smcap">W. E. Channing.</span> <i>Self-Culture.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>


<h3>AUTHORS AS LOVERS OF BOOKS</h3>

<p>I love an author the more for having been himself a lover
of books.... We conceive of Plato as a lover of books; of
Aristotle certainly; of Plutarch, Pliny, Horace, Julian,
and Marcus Aurelius. Virgil, too, must have been one; and,
after a fashion, Martial. May I confess that the passage
which I recollect with the greatest pleasure in Cicero, is
where he says that books delight us at home, <i>and are no
impediment abroad</i>; travel with us, ruralize with us. His
period is rounded off to some purpose: '<i>Delectant domi, non
impediunt foris; peregrinantur, rusticantur.</i>' I am so much
of this opinion, that I do not care to be anywhere without
having a book or books at hand, and like Dr. Orkborne,
in the novel of <i>Camilla</i>, stuff the coach or post-chaise with
them whenever I travel. As books, however, become
ancient, the love of them becomes more unequivocal and
conspicuous. The ancients had little of what we call
learning. They made it. They were also no very eminent
buyers of books&mdash;they made books for posterity. It is true,
that it is not at all necessary to love many books, in order
to love them much. The scholar, in Chaucer, who would
rather have</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i17">At his beddes head<br /></span>
<span class="i1">A twenty bokes, clothed, in black and red,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Of Aristotle and his philosophy,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Than robès rich, or fiddle, or psaltry&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>doubtless beat all our modern collectors in his passion for
reading.... Dante puts Homer, the great ancient, in his
Elysium, upon trust; but a few years afterwards, <i>Homer</i>,
the book, made its appearance in Italy, and Petrarch, in
a transport, put it upon his bookshelves, where he adored
it, like 'the unknown God'. Petrarch ought to be the god
of the Bibliomaniacs, for he was a collector and a man of
genius, which is an union that does not often happen. He
copied out, with his own precious hand, the manuscripts
he rescued from time, and then produced others for time
to reverence. With his head upon a book he died.&mdash;<span class="smcap">J. H.
Leigh Hunt.</span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span> <i>My Books.</i><br /><br /></p>


<p>The sweet serenity of books.&mdash;<span class="smcap">H. W. Longfellow.</span></p>


<h3>THE THEORY OF BOOKS</h3>

<p>Books are the best type of the influence of the past....
The theory of books is noble. The scholar of the first age
received into him the world around; brooded thereon;
gave it the new arrangement of his own mind, and uttered
it again. It came into him, life; it went out from him,
truth. It came to him, short-lived actions; it went out
from him, immortal thoughts. It came to him, business;
it went from him, poetry. It was dead fact; now, it is
quick thought. It can stand, and it can go. It now
endures, it now flies, it now inspires. Precisely in proportion
to the depth of mind from which it issued, so high does it
soar, so long does it sing.&mdash;<span class="smcap">R. W. Emerson.</span> <i>The American
Scholar.</i></p>

<h3>USEFUL AND MIGHTY THINGS</h3>

<p>Except a living man, there is nothing more wonderful
than a book!&mdash;a message to us from the dead&mdash;from
human souls whom we never saw, who lived, perhaps,
thousands of miles away; and yet these, on those little
sheets of paper, speak to us, amuse us, vivify us, teach us,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
comfort us, open their hearts to us as brothers.... I say we
ought to reverence books, to look at them as useful and
mighty things. If they are good and true, whether they are
about religion or politics, farming, trade, or medicine, they
are the message of Christ, the maker of all things, the
teacher of all truth, which He has put into the heart of
some man to speak, that he may tell us what is good for our
spirits, for our bodies, and for our country.&mdash;<span class="smcap">C. Kingsley.</span>

<h3>AN EXTRAORDINARY DELIGHT TO STUDY</h3>

<p>To most kind of men it is an extraordinary delight to
study. For what a world of books offers itself, in all
subjects, arts, and sciences, to the sweet content and capacity
of the reader!... What vast tomes are extant in law,
physic, and divinity, for profit, pleasure, practice, speculation,
in verse or prose, &amp;c.! their names alone are the
subject of whole volumes; we have thousands of authors
of all sorts, many great libraries full well furnished, like
so many dishes of meat, served out for several palates;
and he is a very block that is affected with none of them.&mdash;<span class="smcap">R.

<h3>A TASTE TO BE PRAYED FOR</h3>

<p>If I were to pray for a taste which should stand me in
stead under every variety of circumstances, and be a source
of happiness and cheerfulness to me through life, and a
shield against its ills, however things might go amiss, and
the world frown upon me, it would be a taste for reading.
I speak of it of course only as a worldly advantage, and not
in the slightest degree as superseding or derogating from
the higher office and surer and stronger panoply of religious
principles&mdash;but as a taste, an instrument and a mode of
pleasurable gratification. Give a man this taste, and the
means of gratifying it, and you can hardly fail of making
a happy man, unless, indeed, you put into his hands a most
perverse selection of books. You place him in contact with
the best society in every period of history&mdash;with the wisest,
the wittiest&mdash;with the tenderest, the bravest, and the
purest characters who have adorned humanity. You make
him a denizen of all nations&mdash;a contemporary of all ages.
The world has been created for him.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Sir J. Herschel.</span>

<h3>MORE THAN MEAT, DRINK, AND CLOTHING</h3>

<p>I should like you to see the additional book-room that
we have fitted up, and in which I am now writing.... It
would please you to see such a display of literary wealth,
which is at once the pride of my eye, and the joy of my
heart, and the food of my mind; indeed, more than
metaphorically, meat, drink, and clothing for me and
mine. I verily believe that no one in my station was ever
so rich before, and I am very sure that no one in any
station had ever a more thorough enjoyment of riches of
any kind, or in any way. It is more delightful for me to
live with books than with men, even with all the relish that
I have for such society as is worth having.&mdash;<span class="smcap">R. Southey</span>
(Letter to G. C. Bedford).</p>


<h3>THE BOOK THE HIGHEST DELIGHT</h3>

<p>In the highest civilization the book is still the highest
delight. He who has once known its satisfactions is provided
with a resource against calamity. Like Plato's
disciple who has perceived a truth, 'he is preserved from
harm until another period.' In every man's memory, with
the hours when life culminated, are usually associated certain
books which met his views. Of a large and powerful class
we might ask with confidence, What is the event they most
desire? What gift? What but the book that shall come,
which they have sought through all libraries, through all
languages, that shall be to their mature eyes what many
a tinsel-covered toy pamphlet was to their childhood, and
shall speak to the imagination? Our high respect for
a well-read man is praise enough of literature. If we
encountered a man of rare intellect, we should ask him what
books he read. We expect a great man to be a good reader;
or in proportion to the spontaneous power should be the
assimilating power. And though such are a most difficult
and exacting class, they are not less eager. 'He that
borrows the aid of an equal understanding,' said Burke,
'doubles his own; he that uses that of a superior elevates
his own to the stature of that he contemplates.'</p>

<p>We prize books, and they prize them most who are themselves
wise. Our debt to tradition through reading and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
conversation is so massive, our protest or private addition
so rare and insignificant,&mdash;and this commonly on the ground
of other reading or hearing,&mdash;that, in a large sense, one
would say there is no pure originality. All minds quote.&mdash;<span class="smcap">R.
W. Emerson.</span> <i>Quotation and Originality.</i></p>


<h3>THE PLEASURE DERIVED FROM BOOKS</h3>

<p>It is remarkable, the character of the pleasure we derive
from the best books. They impress us with the conviction
that one nature wrote, and the same reads. We read the
verses of one of the great English poets, of Chaucer, of
Marvell, of Dryden, with the most modern joy,&mdash;with
a pleasure, I mean, which is in great part caused by the
abstraction of all <i>time</i> from their verses. There is some
awe mixed with the joy of our surprise, when this poet, who
lived in some past world, two or three hundred years ago,
says that which lies close to my own soul, that which I also
had wellnigh thought and said.&mdash;<span class="smcap">R. W. Emerson.</span> <i>The
American Scholar.</i></p>


<h3>OUR DEBT TO A BOOK</h3>

<p>Let us not forget the genial miraculous force we have
known to proceed from a book. We go musing into the
vault of day and night; no constellation shines, no muse
descends, the stars are white points, the roses brick-coloured
dust, the frogs pipe, mice peep, and wagons creak along
the road. We return to the house and take up Plutarch or
Augustine, and read a few sentences or pages, and lo! the
air swims with life; the front of heaven is full of fiery
shapes; secrets of magnanimity and grandeur invite us on
every hand; life is made up of them. Such is our debt to
a book.&mdash;<span class="smcap">R. W. Emerson.</span> <i>Thoughts on Modern Literature.</i></p>


<h3>RICH FARE</h3>

<p>A natural turn for reading and intellectual pursuits
probably preserved me from the moral shipwreck, so apt
to befall those who are deprived in early life of the paternal
pilotage. At the very least, my books kept me aloof from
the ring, the dog-pit, the tavern, and the saloon, with their
degrading orgies. For the closet associate of Pope and
Addison&mdash;the mind accustomed to the noble, though silent,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
discourse of Shakespeare and Milton&mdash;will hardly seek, or
put up with, low company and slang. The reading animal
will not be content with the brutish wallowings that satisfy
the unlearned pigs of the world.</p>

<p>Later experience enables me to depose to the comfort
and blessing that literature can prove in seasons of sickness
and sorrow&mdash;how powerfully intellectual pursuits can help
in keeping the head from crazing, and the heart from
breaking,&mdash;nay, not to be too grave, how generous mental
food can even atone for a meagre diet&mdash;rich fare on the
paper for short commons on the cloth.</p>

<p>Poisoned by the malaria of the Dutch marshes, my
stomach, for many months, resolutely set itself against
fish, flesh, or fowl; my appetite had no more edge than
the German knife placed before me. But, luckily, the
mental palate and digestion were still sensible and vigorous;
and whilst I passed untasted every dish at the Rhenish
<i>table d'hôte</i>, I could yet enjoy my <i>Peregrine Pickle</i>, and the
feast after the manner of the ancients. There was no
yearning towards calf's head <i>à la tortue</i>, or sheep's heart;
but I could still relish Head <i>à la Brunnen</i> and the <i>Heart of
Midlothian</i>.</p>

<p>Still more recently, it was my misfortune, with a tolerable
appetite, to be condemned to lenten fare, like Sancho
Panza, by my physician&mdash;to a diet, in fact, lower than any
prescribed by the poor-law commissioners; all animal food,
from a bullock to a rabbit, being strictly interdicted; as
well as all fluids stronger than that which lays dust, washes
pinafores, and waters polyanthus. But 'the feast of reason
and the flow of soul' were still mine. Denied beef, I had
<i>Bul</i>wer and <i>Cow</i>per,&mdash;forbidden mutton, there was <i>Lamb</i>,&mdash;and
in lieu of pork, the great <i>Bacon</i> or <i>Hogg</i>.</p>

<p>Then, as to beverage, it was hard, doubtless, for a
Christian to set his face like a Turk against the juice of the
grape. But, eschewing wine, I had still my <i>Butler</i>; and in
the absence of liquor, all the <i>choice spirits</i> from Tom Browne
to Tom Moore.</p>

<p>Thus, though confined, physically, to the drink that
drowns kittens, I quaffed mentally, not merely the best of
our own home-made, but the rich, racy, sparkling growths of
France and Italy, of Germany and Spain&mdash;the champagne<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
of Molière, and the Monte Pulciano of Boccaccio, the hock
of Schiller, and the sherry of Cervantes. Depressed bodily
by the fluid that damps everything, I got intellectually
elevated with Milton, a little merry with Swift, or rather
jolly with Rabelais, whose Pantagruel, by the way, is quite
equal to the best gruel with rum in it.</p>

<p>So far can literature palliate or compensate for gastronomical
privations. But there are other evils, great and
small, in this world, which try the stomach less than the
head, the heart, and the temper&mdash;bowls that will not roll
right&mdash;well-laid schemes that will 'gang aglee'&mdash;and ill
winds that blow with the pertinacity of the monsoon. Of
these, Providence has allotted me a full share; but still,
paradoxical as it may sound, my <i>burden</i> has been greatly
lightened by a <i>load of books</i>. The manner of this will be best
understood by a feline illustration. Everybody has heard
of the two Kilkenny cats, who devoured each other; but
it is not so generally known that they left behind them an
orphan kitten, which, true to the breed, began to eat itself
up, till it was diverted from the operation by a mouse.
Now, the human mind, under vexation, is like that kitten,
for it is apt to <i>prey upon itself</i>, unless drawn off by a new
object; and none better for the purpose than a book; for
example, one of Defoe's; for who, in reading his thrilling
<i>History of the Great Plague</i>, would not be reconciled to a few
little ones?</p>

<p>Many, many a dreary, weary hour have I got over&mdash;many
a gloomy misgiving postponed&mdash;many a mental or
bodily annoyance forgotten, by help of the tragedies and
comedies of our dramatists and novelists! Many a trouble
has been soothed by the still small voice of the moral
philosopher&mdash;many a dragon-like care charmed to sleep by
the sweet song of the poet, for all which I cry incessantly,
not aloud, but in my heart, Thanks and honour to the
glorious masters of the pen, and the great inventors of the
press! Such has been my own experience of the blessing and
comfort of literature and intellectual pursuits; and of the
same mind, doubtless, was Sir Humphry Davy, who went
for 'consolations in <i>Travel</i>', not to the inn or the posting
house, but to his library and his books.&mdash;<span class="smcap">T. Hood</span> (Letter
to the Manchester Athenaeum, 1843).</p>

<h3>THE COMMODITY REAPED OF BOOKS</h3>

<p>The commerce of books comforts me in age and solaceth
me in solitariness. It easeth me of the burthen of a wearisome
sloth: and at all times rids me of tedious companies:
it abateth the edge of fretting sorrow, on condition it be
not extreme and over-insolent. To divert me from any
importunate imagination or insinuating conceit, there is no
better way than to have recourse unto books; with ease
they allure me to them, and with facility they remove them
all. And though they perceive I neither frequent nor seek
them, but wanting other more essential, lively, and more
natural commodities, they never mutiny or murmur at me;
but still entertain me with one and self-same visage....</p>

<p>The sick man is not to be moaned that hath his health in
his sleeve. In the experience and use of this sentence,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
which is most true, consisteth all the commodity I reap of
books. In effect I make no other use of them than those
who know them not. I enjoy them, as a miser doth his gold;
to know that I may enjoy them when I list, my mind is
settled and satisfied with the right of possession. I never
travel without books, nor in peace nor in war: yet do
I pass many days and months without using them. It
shall be anon, say I, or to-morrow, or when I please; in
the meanwhile the time runs away, and passeth without
hurting me. For it is wonderful what repose I take, and
how I continue in this consideration, that they are at my
elbow to delight me when time shall serve; and in acknowledging
what assistance they give unto my life. This is the
best munition I have found in this human peregrination,
and I extremely bewail those men of understanding that
want the same. I accept with better will all other kinds of
amusements, how slight soever, forsomuch as this cannot
fail me.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Montaigne.</span></p>

<h3>OF THE ENTERTAINMENT OF BOOKS</h3>

<p>The diversions of reading, though they are not always of
the strongest kind, yet they generally leave a better effect
than the grosser satisfactions of sense: for, if they are well
chosen, they neither dull the appetite nor strain the capacity.
On the contrary, they refresh the inclinations, and strengthen
the power, and improve under experiment: and, which is
best of all, they entertain and perfect at the same time; and
convey wisdom and knowledge through pleasure. By reading
a man does as it were antedate his life, and makes
himself contemporary with the ages past. And this way of
running up beyond one's nativity is much better than
Plato's pre-existence; because here a man knows something
of the state and is the wiser for it; which he is not
in the other.</p>

<p>In conversing with books we may choose our company,
and disengage without ceremony or exception. Here we are
free from the formalities of custom and respect: we need
not undergo the penance of a dull story from a fop of figure;
but may shake off the haughty, the impertinent, and the
vain, at pleasure. Besides, authors, like women, commonly
dress when they make a visit. Respect to themselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
makes them polish their thoughts, and exert the force of
their understanding more than they would or can do in
ordinary conversation: so that the reader has as it were
the spirit and essence in a narrow compass; which was
drawn off from a much larger proportion of time, labour,
and expense. Like an heir, he is born rather than made
rich; and comes into a stock of sense, with little or no
trouble of his own. 'Tis true, a fortune in knowledge which
descends in this manner, as well as an inherited estate, is too
often neglected and squandered away; because we do not
consider the difficulty in raising it.</p>

<p>Books are a guide in youth, and an entertainment for
age. They support us under solitude, and keep us from
being a burthen to ourselves. They help us to forget the
crossness of men and things; compose our cares and our
passions; and lay our disappointments asleep. When we
are weary of the living, we may repair to the dead, who
have nothing of peevishness, pride, or design in their conversation.
However, to be constantly in the wheel has
neither pleasure nor improvement in it. A man may as
well expect to grow stronger by always eating, as wiser by
always reading. Too much overcharges Nature, and turns
more into disease than nourishment. 'Tis thought and
digestion which makes books serviceable, and gives health
and vigour to the mind. Neither ought we to be too implicit
or resigning to authorities, but to examine before we assent,
and preserve our reason in its just liberties. To walk always
upon crutches is the way to lose the use of our limbs. Such
an absolute submission keeps us in a perpetual minority,
breaks the spirits of the understanding, and lays us open
to imposture.</p>

<p>But books well managed afford direction and discovery.
They strengthen the organ and enlarge the prospect, and
give a more universal insight into things than can be
learned from unlettered observation. He who depends
only upon his own experience has but a few materials to
work upon. He is confined to narrow limits both of place
and time: and is not fit to draw a large model and to pronounce
upon business which is complicated and unusual.
There seems to be much the same difference between a man
of mere practice and another of learning as there is between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
an empiric and a physician. The first may have a good
recipe, or two; and if diseases and patients were very
scarce, and all alike, he might do tolerably well. But if you
inquire concerning the causes of distempers, the constitution
of human bodies, the danger of symptoms, and the
methods of cure, upon which the success of medicine
depends, he knows little of the matter. On the other side,
to take measures wholly from books, without looking into
men and business, is like travelling in a map, where, though
countries and cities are well enough distinguished, yet
villages and private seats are either overlooked, or too
generally marked for a stranger to find. And therefore he
that would be a master must draw by the life, as well as
copy from originals, and join theory and experience together.&mdash;J. COLLIER.
<i>Essays upon several Moral Subjects.</i>

<h3>INSTRUCTION OR AMUSEMENT</h3>

<p>Books, we are told, propose to <i>instruct</i> or to <i>amuse</i>.
Indeed! However, not to spend any words upon it, I suppose
you will admit that this wretched antithesis will be of no
service to us.... For this miserable alternative being once
admitted, observe what follows. In which class of books
does the <i>Paradise Lost</i> stand? Among those which instruct
or those which amuse? Now, if a man answers, among
those which instruct,&mdash;he lies: for there is no instruction in
it, nor could be in any great poem, according to the meaning
which the word must bear in this distinction, unless it is
meant that it should involve its own antithesis. But if he
says, 'No&mdash;amongst those which amuse,'&mdash;then what a beast
must he be to degrade, and in this way, what has done the
most of any human work to raise and dignify human nature.
But the truth is, you see, that the idiot does not wish to
degrade it; on the contrary, he would willingly tell a lie in
its favour, if that would be admitted; but such is the
miserable state of slavery to which he has reduced himself
by his own puny distinction; for, as soon as he hops out
of one of his little cells he is under a necessity of hopping
into the other. The true antithesis to knowledge in this case
is not <i>pleasure</i>, but power. All, that is literature, seeks to
communicate power; all, that is not literature, to communicate
knowledge.&mdash;<span class="smcap">T. De Quincey.</span> <i>Letters to a Young Man.</i></p>

<h3>EXERCISE FOR THE MIND</h3>

<p>From my own Apartment, March 16, 1709</p>

<p>Reading is to the mind what exercise is to the body.
As by the one health is preserved, strengthened, and invigorated;
by the other, virtue (which is the health of the
mind) is kept alive, cherished, and confirmed. But as
exercise becomes tedious and painful when we make use
of it only as the means of health, so reading is apt to grow
uneasy and burdensome when we apply ourselves to it
only for our improvement in virtue. For this reason the
virtue which we gather from a fable or an allegory is like
health we get by hunting; as we are engaged in an agreeable
pursuit that draws us on with pleasure, and makes us
insensible of the fatigues that accompany it.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Sir R.
Steele.</span> <i>Tatler</i>, 147.</p>


<h3>WHY BOOKS WERE INVENTED</h3>

<p>Books were invented to take off the odium of immediate
superiority and soften the rigour of duties prescribed by the
teachers and censors of human kind&mdash;setting at least those
who are acknowledged wiser than ourselves at a distance.
When we recollect, however, that for this very reason they
are seldom consulted and little obeyed, how much cause
shall his contemporaries have to rejoice that their living
Johnson forced them to feel the reproofs due to vice and
folly&mdash;while Seneca and Tillotson were no longer able to
make impression except on our shelves.&mdash;<span class="smcap">T. Percy.</span></p>


<h3>WHY BOOKS ARE READ</h3>

<p>It is difficult to enumerate the several motives which
procure to books the honour of perusal: spite, vanity, and
curiosity, hope and fear, love and hatred, every passion
which incites to any other action, serves at one time or
another to stimulate a reader.</p>

<p>Some are found to take a celebrated volume into their
hands, because they hope to distinguish their penetration
by finding faults that have escaped the public; others
eagerly buy it in the first bloom of reputation, that they
may join the chorus of praise, and not lag, as Falstaff terms
it, in 'the rearward of the fashion'.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>Some read for style, and some for argument: one has
little care about the sentiment, he observes only how it is
expressed; another regards not the conclusion, but is
diligent to mark how it is inferred; they read for other
purposes than the attainment of practical knowledge, and
are no more likely to grow wise by an examination of
a treatise of moral prudence than an architect to inflame
his devotion by considering attentively the proportions of
a temple.</p>

<p>Some read that they may embellish their conversation,
or shine in dispute; some that they may not be detected
in ignorance, or want the reputation of literary accomplishments:
but the most general and prevalent reason of study
is the impossibility of finding another amusement equally
cheap or constant, equally independent of the hour or the
weather. He that wants money to follow the chase of
pleasure through her yearly circuit, and is left at home
when the gay world rolls to Bath or Tunbridge; he whose
gout compels him to hear from his chamber the rattle of
chariots transporting happier beings to plays and assemblies,
will be forced to seek in books a refuge from himself.&mdash;<span class="smcap">S.
Johnson.</span> <i>Adventurer</i>, 137.</p>


<h3>THE INFLUENCE OF BOOKS</h3>

<p>Every person of tolerable education has been considerably
influenced by the books he has read, and remembers
with a kind of gratitude several of those that made without
injury the earliest and the strongest impression. It is
pleasing at a more advanced period to look again into the
early favourites, though the mature person may wonder
how some of them had once power to absorb his passions,
make him retire into a lonely wood in order to read unmolested,
repel the approaches of sleep, or, when it came,
infect it with visions. A capital part of the proposed task
would be to recollect the books that have been read with
the greatest interest, the periods when they were read,
the partiality which any of them inspired to a particular
mode of life, to a study, to a system of opinions, or to a class
of human characters; to note the counteraction of later
ones (where we have been sensible of it) to the effect pro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>duced
by the former; and then to endeavour to estimate
the whole and ultimate influence.</p>

<p>Considering the multitude of facts, sentiments, and
characters, which have been contemplated by a person
who has read much, the effect, one would think, must have
been very great. Still, however, it is probable that a very
small number of books will have the pre-eminence in our
mental history. Perhaps your memory will promptly recur
to six or ten that have contributed more to your present
habits of feeling and thought than all the rest together.&mdash;<span class="smcap">J.
Foster.</span> <i>On a Man's Writing Memoirs of Himself.</i></p>


<h3>REMUNERATIVE READING</h3>

<p>Cultivate above all things a taste for reading. There is
no pleasure so cheap, so innocent, and so remunerative as
the real, hearty pleasure and taste for reading. It does
not come to every one naturally. Some people take to it
naturally, and others do not; but I advise you to cultivate
it, and endeavour to promote it in your minds. In order to
do that you should read what amuses you and pleases you.
You should not begin with difficult works, because, if you
do, you will find the pursuit dry and tiresome. I would
even say to you, read novels, read frivolous books, read
anything that will amuse you and give you a taste for
reading. On this point all persons could put themselves
on an equality. Some persons would say they would rather
spend their time in society; but it must be remembered
that if they had cultivated a taste for reading beforehand
they would be in a position to choose their society, whereas,
if they had not, the probabilities were that they would have
to mix with people inferior to themselves.&mdash;<span class="smcap">R. Lowe, Lord
Sherbrooke.</span> <i>Speech to the Students of the Croydon Science
and Art Schools</i>, 1869.<br /><br /></p>

<h3>THE MOOD FOR BOOKS</h3>

<p>How the mood for a book sometimes rushes upon one,
either one knows not why, or in consequence, perhaps, of
some most trifling suggestion. Yesterday I was walking
at dusk. I came to an old farmhouse; at the garden gate
a vehicle stood waiting, and I saw it was our doctor's gig.
Having passed, I turned to look back. There was a faint
afterglow in the sky beyond the chimneys; a light twinkled
at one of the upper windows. I said to myself, '<i>Tristram
Shandy</i>,' and hurried home to plunge into a book which
I have not opened for I dare say twenty years.</p>

<p>Not long ago, I awoke one morning and suddenly thought
of the Correspondence between Goethe and Schiller; and
so impatient did I become to open the book that I got up
an hour earlier than usual. A book worth rising for;
much better worth than old Burton, who pulled Johnson
out of bed. A book which helps one to forget the idle
or venomous chatter going on everywhere about us, and
bids us cherish hope for a world 'which has such people
in't'.</p>

<p>These volumes I had at hand; I could reach them down
from my shelves at the moment when I hungered for them.
But it often happens that the book which comes into my
mind could only be procured with trouble and delay;
I breathe regretfully and put aside the thought. Ah! the
books that one will never read again. They gave delight,
perchance something more; they left a perfume in the
memory; but life has passed them by for ever. I have
but to muse, and one after another they rise before me.
Books gentle and quieting; books noble and inspiring;
books that well merit to be pored over, not once but many
a time. Yet never again shall I hold them in my hand;
the years fly too quickly, and are too few. Perhaps when
I lie waiting for the end, some of these lost books will
come into my wandering thoughts, and I shall remember
them as friends to whom I owed a kindness&mdash;friends passed
upon the way. What regret in that last farewell!&mdash;<span class="smcap">G.
Gissing.</span> <i>The Private Papers of Henry Ryecroft.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>


<h3>BY DIVINE INSPIRATION</h3>

<p>Now it is, that the minds of men are qualified with all
manner of discipline, and the old sciences revived, which
for many ages were extinct. Now it is, that the learned
languages are to their pristine purity restored, viz. Greek,
without which a man may be ashamed to account himself
a scholar, Hebrew, Arabic, Chaldean, and Latin. Printing
likewise is now in use, so elegant and so correct, that better
cannot be imagined, although it was found out but in my
time by a divine inspiration, as, by a diabolical suggestion
on the other side, was the invention of ordnance. All the
world is full of knowing men, of most learned schoolmasters,
and vast libraries; and it appears to me as a truth, that
neither in Plato's time, nor Cicero's, nor Papinian's, there
was ever such conveniency for studying, as we see at this
day there is. Nor must any adventure henceforward to
come in public, or present himself in company, that hath
not been pretty well polished in the shop of Minerva. I see
robbers, hangmen, freebooters, tapsters, ostlers, and such
like, of the very rubbish of the people, more learned now
than the doctors and preachers were in my time. What
shall I say? The very women and children have aspired
to this praise and celestial manna of good learning.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Rabelais.</span>
<i>The Life of Gargantua and of Pantagruel.</i></p>


<h3>PERMANENCE FOR THOUGHT</h3>

<p>I saw a man, who bore in his hands the same instruments
as our modern smith's, presenting a vase, which appeared
to be made of iron, amidst the acclamations of an assembled
multitude engaged in triumphal procession before the
altars dignified by the name of Apollo at Delphi; and
I saw in the same place men who carried rolls of papyrus
in their hands and wrote upon them with reeds containing
ink made from the soot of wood mixed with a solution of
glue. 'See,' the genius said, 'an immense change produced
in the condition of society by the two arts of which you
here see the origin; the one, that of rendering iron malleable,
which is owing to a single individual, an obscure Greek;
the other, that of making thought permanent in written
characters, an art which has gradually arisen from the
hieroglyphics which you may observe on yonder pyramids.'&mdash;<span class="smcap">Sir
H. Davy.</span> <i>Consolations in Travel.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>


<h3>THE MIRACULOUS ART OF WRITING</h3>

<p>Certainly the Art of Writing is the most miraculous
of all things man has devised. Odin's <i>Runes</i> were the first
form of the work of a Hero; <i>Books</i>, written words, are still
miraculous <i>Runes</i>, the latest form! In Books lies the <i>soul</i>
of the whole Past Time; the articulate audible voice of
the Past, when the body and material substance of it has
altogether vanished like a dream. Mighty fleets and
armies, harbours and arsenals, vast cities, high-domed,
many-engined,&mdash;they are precious, great: but what do
they become? Agamemnon, the many Agamemnons,
Pericleses, and their Greece; all is gone now to some
ruined fragments, dumb mournful wrecks and blocks: but
the Books of Greece! There Greece, to every thinker, still
very literally lives; can be called-up again into life. No
magic Rune is stranger than a Book. All that Mankind has
done, thought, gained, or been: it is lying as in magic
preservation in the pages of Books. They are the chosen
possession of men. Do not Books still accomplish <i>miracles</i>,
as <i>Runes</i> were fabled to do? They persuade men. Not the
wretchedest circulating-library novel, which foolish girls
thumb and con in remote villages, but will help to regulate
the actual practical weddings and households of those
foolish girls. So 'Celia' felt, so 'Clifford' acted: the
foolish Theorem of Life, stamped into those young brains,
comes out as a solid Practice one day. Consider whether
any <i>Rune</i> in the wildest imagination of mythologist ever
did such wonders as, on the actual firm Earth, some Books
have done! What built St. Paul's Cathedral? Look at
the heart of the matter, it was that divine Hebrew <span class="smcap">Book</span>&mdash;the
word partly of the man Moses, an outlaw tending his
Midianitish herds, four thousand years ago, in the wildernesses
of Sinai! It is the strangest of things, yet nothing is truer.
With the art of Writing, of which Printing is a simple, an
inevitable, and comparatively insignificant corollary, the
true reign of miracles for mankind commenced. It related,
with a wondrous new contiguity and perpetual closeness,
the Past and Distant with the Present in time and place;
all times and all places with this our actual Here and Now.
All things were altered for men; all modes of important
work of men.&mdash;<span class="smcap">T. Carlyle.</span> <i>Heroes and Hero-Worship.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>


<h3>BOOKS AS MEMORIALS</h3>

<p>In books we find the dead as it were living; in books we
foresee things to come; in books warlike affairs are methodized;
the rights of peace proceed from books. All things
are corrupted and decayed with time. Saturn never ceases
to devour those whom he generates; insomuch that the
glory of the world would be lost in oblivion if God had not
provided mortals with a remedy in books. Alexander the
ruler of the world; Julius the invader of the world and of
the city, the just who in unity of person assumed the
empire in arms and arts; the faithful Fabricius, the rigid
Cato, would at this day have been without a memorial if
the aid of books had failed them. Towers are razed to the
earth, cities overthrown, triumphal arches mouldered to
dust; nor can the King or Pope be found upon whom the
privilege of a lasting name can be conferred more easily
than by books. A book made, renders succession to the
author: for as long as the book exists, the author remaining
[Greek: athanatos] immortal, cannot perish.&mdash;<span class="smcap">R. de Bury.</span> <i>Philobiblon.</i></p>


<h3>FASHION IN BOOKS</h3>

<p>We commonly see the book that at Christmas lieth bound
on the stationer's stall, at Easter to be broken in the
Haberdasher's shop, which sith it is the order of proceeding,
I am content this winter to have my doings read for a toy,
that in summer they may be ready for trash. It is not
strange when as the greatest wonder lasteth but nine days,
that a new work should not endure but three months.
Gentlemen use books, as gentlewomen handle their flowers,
who in the morning stick them in their heads, and at night
straw them at their heels. Cherries be fulsome when they
be through ripe, because they be plenty, and books be stale
when they be printed, in that they be common. In my
mind Printers and Tailors are bound chiefly to pray for
gentlemen, the one hath so many fantasies to print, the
other such divers fashions to make, that the pressing iron
of the one is never out of the fire, nor the printing press of
the other any time lieth still. But a fashion is but a day's
wearing, and a book but an hour's reading, which seeing it
is so, I am of a shoemaker's mind, who careth not so the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
shoe hold the plucking on, nor I, so my labours last the
running over. He that cometh in print because he would
be known, is like the fool that cometh into the market
because he would be seen.&mdash;<span class="smcap">J. Lyly.</span> <i>Euphues.</i></p>

they cannot make so little accompt of me, as then I shall do
of them. All the commerce I have in this with the world
is that I borrow the instruments of their writing, as more
speedy and more easy; in requital whereof I may peradventure
hinder the melting of some piece of butter in the

and foreign, as all other books.... What if I lend mine ears
somewhat more attentively unto books, sith I but watch
if I can filch something from them wherewith to enamel
and uphold mine? I never study to make a book, yet have
I somewhat studied, because I had already made it (if to
nibble or pinch, by the head or feet, now one author and

<h3>ENDURING MONUMENTS</h3>

<p>We see then how far the monuments of wit and learning
are more durable than the monuments of power or of the
hands. For have not the verses of Homer continued
twenty-five hundred years, or more, without the loss of
a syllable or letter; during which time infinite palaces,
temples, castles, cities, have been decayed and demolished?
It is not possible to have the true pictures or statues of
Cyrus, Alexander, Caesar, no, nor of the kings or great
personages of much later years; for the originals cannot
last, and the copies cannot but leese of the life and truth.
But the images of men's wits and knowledges remain in
books, exempted from the wrong of time and capable of
perpetual renovation. Neither are they fitly to be called
images, because they generate still, and cast their seeds in
the minds of others, provoking and causing infinite actions
and opinions in succeeding ages. So that if the invention
of the ship was thought so noble, which carrieth riches and
commodities from place to place, and consociateth the most
remote regions in participation of their fruits, how much
more are letters to be magnified, which as ships pass
through the vast seas of time, and make ages so distant
to participate of the wisdom, illuminations, and inventions,
the one of the other?&mdash;<span class="smcap">F. Bacon, Lord Verulam.</span> <i>Of the
Advancement of Learning.</i></p>

<h3>THE STRANGE QUALITY OF BOOKS</h3>

<p>Books have that strange quality, that being of the
frailest and tenderest matter, they outlast brass, iron and
marble; and though their habitations and walls, by uncivil
hands, be many times overthrown; and they themselves,
by foreign force, be turned prisoners, yet do they often, as
their authors, keep their giver's names; seeming rather
to change places and masters than to suffer a full ruin and
total wreck. So, many of the books of Constantinople
changed Greece for France and Italy; and in our time,
that famous Library in the Palatinate changed Heidelberg
for the Vatican. And this I think no small duty, nor
meaner gift and retribution, which I render back again to
my benefactor's honest fame, being a greater matter than
riches; riches being momentany and evanishing, scarce
possessed by the third heir; fame immortal, and almost
everlasting; by fame riches is often acquired, seldom
fame by riches; except when it is their good hap to fall
in the possession of some generous-minded man. And
though a philosopher said of famous men, disdainfully,
that they died two deaths, one in their bodies, another, long
after, in their names, he must confess, that where other
men live but one life, famous men live two.&mdash;<span class="smcap">W. Drummond.</span>

<h3>BOOKS ARE NOT DEAD THINGS</h3>

<p>I deny not but that it is of greatest concernment in the
Church and Commonwealth to have a vigilant eye how
books demean themselves, as well as men; and thereafter
to confine, imprison, and do sharpest justice on them as
malefactors. For books are not absolutely dead things, but
do contain a potency of life in them to be as active as that
soul was whose progeny they are; nay, they do preserve,
as in a vial, the purest efficacy and extraction of that living
intellect that bred them. I know they are as lively and as
vigorously productive as those fabulous dragon's teeth;
and, being sown up and down, may chance to spring up
armed men. And yet, on the other hand, unless wariness
be used, as good almost kill a man as kill a good book.
Who kills a man kills a reasonable creature, God's image;
but he who destroys a good book, kills reason itself; kills<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
the image of God, as it were, in the eye. Many a man lives
a burden to the earth; but a good book is the precious
life-blood of a master-spirit, embalmed and treasured up
on purpose to a life beyond life. 'Tis true no age can restore
a life, whereof, perhaps, there is no great loss; and revolutions
of ages do not oft recover the loss of a rejected
truth, for the want of which whole nations fare the worse.
We should be wary, therefore, what persecution we raise
against the living labours of public men, how we spill that
seasoned life of man preserved and stored up in books;
since we see a kind of homicide may be thus committed,
sometimes a martyrdom, and if it extend to the whole
impression, a kind of massacre, whereof the execution ends
not in the slaying of an elemental life, but strikes at that
ethereal and fifth essence&mdash;the breath of reason itself;
slays an immortality rather than a life.&mdash;<span class="smcap">J. Milton.</span>

<h3>SHAKESPEARE IN HEAVEN</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Boswell.</span> 'There is a strange unwillingness to part
with life, independent of serious fears as to futurity.

feels an uneasiness at the thoughts of leaving his house, his

<p><span class="smcap">Johnson.</span> 'This is foolish in &mdash;&mdash; [Percy?]. A man
need not be uneasy on these grounds; for, as he will retain
his consciousness, he may say with the philosopher, <i>Omnia
mea mecum porto</i>.'</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Boswell.</span> 'True, Sir: we may carry our books in our
heads; but still there is something painful in the thought
of leaving for ever what has given us pleasure. I remember,
many years ago, when my imagination was warm, and
I happened to be in a melancholy mood, it distressed me
to think of going into a state of being in which Shakespeare's
poetry did not exist. A lady whom I then much admired,
a very amiable woman, humoured my fancy, and relieved
me by saying, "The first thing you will meet in the other
world will be an elegant copy of Shakespeare's works presented
to you."'</p>

<p>Dr. Johnson smiled benignantly at this, and did not appear
to disapprove of the notion.&mdash;<span class="smcap">J. Boswell.</span> <i>Life of Johnson.</i></p>

<h3>THE ONLY THINGS THAT LAST FOR EVER</h3>

<p>Actions pass away and are forgotten, or are only discernible
in their effects; conquerors, statesmen, and kings
live but by their names stamped on the page of history.
Hume says rightly that more people think about Virgil and
Homer (and that continually) than ever trouble their heads
about Caesar or Alexander. In fact, poets are a longer-lived
race than heroes: they breathe more of the air of
immortality. They survive more entire in their thoughts
and acts. We have all that Virgil or Homer did, as much as
if we had lived at the same time with them: we can hold
their works in our hands, or lay them on our pillows, or put
them to our lips. Scarcely a trace of what the others did is
left upon the earth, so as to be visible to common eyes.
The one, the dead authors, are living men, still breathing
and moving in their writings. The others, the conquerors
of the world, are but the ashes in an urn. The sympathy
(so to speak) between thought and thought is more intimate
and vital than that between thought and action. Thought
is linked to thought as flame kindles into flame: the
tribute of admiration to the manes of departed heroism is
like burning incense in a marble monument. Words, ideas,
feelings, with the progress of time harden into substances:
things, bodies, actions, moulder away, or melt into a sound,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
into thin air!&mdash;Yet though the schoolmen in the Middle
Ages disputed more about the texts of Aristotle than the
battle of Arbela, perhaps Alexander's Generals in his lifetime
admired his pupil as much and liked him better. For
not only a man's actions are effaced and vanish with him;
his virtues and generous qualities die with him also: his
intellect only is immortal and bequeathed unimpaired to
posterity. Words are the only things that last for ever.&mdash;<span class="smcap">W.
Hazlitt.</span> <i>Table Talk.</i></p>


<h3>THE AUTHORS' METAMORPHOSIS</h3>

<p>How pleasant it is to reflect, that all these lovers of
books have themselves become books! What better
metamorphosis could Pythagoras have desired! How
Ovid and Horace exulted in anticipating theirs! And how
the world have justified their exultation! They had
a right to triumph over brass and marble. It is the only
visible change which changes no further; which generates
and yet is not destroyed. Consider: mines themselves are
exhausted; cities perish; kingdoms are swept away, and
man weeps with indignation to think that his own body is
not immortal.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">Muoiono le città, muoiono i regni,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">E l'uom d'esser mortal par che si sdegni.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Yet this little body of thought, that lies before me in the
shape of a book, has existed thousands of years, nor since
the invention of the press can anything short of an universal
convulsion of nature abolish it. To a shape like this, so
small yet so comprehensive, so slight yet so lasting, so
insignificant yet so venerable, turns the mighty activity of
Homer, and, so turning, is enabled to live and warm us for
ever. To a shape like this turns the placid sage of Academus:
to a shape like this the grandeur of Milton, the
exuberance of Spenser, the pungent elegance of Pope, and
the volatility of Prior. In one small room, like the compressed
spirits of Milton, can be gathered together</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">The assembled souls of all that men held wise.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>May I hope to become the meanest of these existences?
This is a question which every author who is a lover of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
books asks himself some time in his life; and which must
be pardoned, because it cannot be helped. I know not.
I cannot exclaim with the poet,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">Oh that my name were numbered among theirs,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Then gladly would I end my mortal days.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>For my mortal days, few and feeble as the rest of them
may be, are of consequence to others. But I should like
to remain visible in this shape. The little of myself that
pleases myself I could wish to be accounted worth pleasing
others. I should like to survive so, were it only for the
sake of those who love me in private, knowing as I do
what a treasure is the possession of a friend's mind, when
he is no more. At all events, nothing while I live and think
can deprive me of my value for such treasures. I can help
the appreciation of them while I last, and love them till
I die; and perhaps, if fortune turns her face once more in
kindness upon me before I go, I may chance, some quiet
day, to lay my overbeating temples on a book, and so have
the death I most envy.&mdash;<span class="smcap">J. H. Leigh Hunt.</span> <i>My Books.</i></p>

<h3>THE VIRTUE OF A TRUE BOOK</h3>

<p>Visible and tangible products of the Past, again, I
reckon-up to the extent of three: Cities, with their Cabinets
and Arsenals; then tilled Fields, to either or to both of
which divisions Roads with their Bridges may belong; and
thirdly&mdash;Books. In which third, truly, the last invented,
lies a worth far surpassing that of the two others. Wondrous
indeed is the virtue of a true Book! Not like a dead
city of stones, yearly crumbling, yearly needing repair;
more like a tilled field, but then a spiritual field: like
a spiritual tree, let me rather say, it stands from year to
year, and from age to age (we have Books that already<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
number some hundred-and-fifty human ages); and yearly
comes its new produce of leaves (Commentaries, Deductions,
Philosophical, Political Systems; or were it only Sermons,
Pamphlets, Journalistic Essays), every one of which is
talismanic and thaumaturgic, for it can persuade men.
O thou who art able to write a Book, which once in the two
centuries or oftener there is a man gifted to do, envy not
him whom they name City-builder, and inexpressibly pity
him whom they name Conqueror or City-burner! Thou too
art a Conqueror and Victor; but of the true sort, namely
over the Devil: thou too hast built what will outlast all
marble and metal, and be a wonder-bringing City of the
Mind, a Temple and Seminary and Prophetic Mount,
whereto all kindreds of the Earth will pilgrim.&mdash;<span class="smcap">T. Carlyle.</span>
<i>Sartor Resartus.</i></p>


<h3>ACTION AND REACTION</h3>

<p>Some of the well-puffed fashionable novels of eighteen
hundred and twenty-nine hold the pastry of eighteen
hundred and thirty; and others, which are now extolled
in language almost too high-flown for the merits of <i>Don
Quixote</i>, will, we have no doubt, line the trunks of eighteen
hundred and thirty-one.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Lord Macaulay.</span> <i>Mr. Robert
Montgomery's Poems.</i></p>


<h3>THE ULTIMATE TEST OF BOOKS</h3>

<p>Some of the Histories that our age has produced are books
in the truest sense of the word. They illustrate great periods
in our own annals, and in the annals of other countries.
They show what a divine discipline has been at work to
form men; they teach us that there is such a discipline at
work to form us into men. That is the test to which I have
urged that all books must at last be brought; if they do not
bear it, their doom is fixed. They may be light or heavy,
the penny sheet or the vast folio; they may speak of things
seen or unseen; of Science or Art; of what has been or
what is to be; they may amuse us or weary us, flatter us
or scorn us; if they do not assist to make us better and more
substantial men, they are only providing fuel for a fire larger,
and more utterly destructive, than that which consumed the
Library of the Ptolemies.&mdash;<span class="smcap">F. D. Maurice.</span> <i>On Books.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>


<h3>BOOKS OF THE HOUR AND OF ALL TIME</h3>

<p>All books are divisible into two classes, the books of the
hour, and the books of all time. Mark this distinction&mdash;it
is not one of quality only. It is not merely the bad book
that does not last, and the good one that does. It is a distinction
of species. There are good books for the hour, and
good ones for all time; bad books for the hour, and bad
ones for all time. I must define the two kinds before I go
farther.</p>

<p>The good book of the hour, then,&mdash;I do not speak of the
bad ones&mdash;is simply the useful or pleasant talk of some
person whom you cannot otherwise converse with, printed
for you. Very useful often, telling you what you need to
know; very pleasant often, as a sensible friend's present
talk would be. These bright accounts of travels; good-humoured
and witty discussions of question; lively or
pathetic story-telling in the form of novel; firm fact-telling,
by the real agents concerned in the events of passing
history;&mdash;all these books of the hour, multiplying among
us as education becomes more general, are a peculiar
characteristic and possession of the present age: we ought
to be entirely thankful for them, and entirely ashamed
of ourselves if we make no good use of them. But we make
the worst possible use, if we allow them to usurp the place of
true books: for, strictly speaking, they are not books at all,
but merely letters or newspapers in good print.... A book
is written, not to multiply the voice merely, not to carry it
merely, but to preserve it. The author has something to say
which he perceives to be true and useful, or helpfully beautiful.
So far as he knows, no one has yet said it; so far as he knows,
no one else can say it. He is bound to say it, clearly and melodiously
if he may; clearly, at all events. In the sum of
his life he finds this to be the thing, or group of things,
manifest to him;&mdash;this the piece of true knowledge, or
sight, which his share of sunshine and earth has permitted
him to seize. He would fain set it down for ever; engrave
it on rock, if he could; saying, 'This is the best of me; for
the rest, I ate, and drank, and slept, loved, and hated, like
another; my life was as the vapour, and is not; but this
I saw and knew: this, if anything of mine, is worth your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
memory.' That is his 'writing'; it is, in his small human
way, and with whatever degree of true inspiration is in
him, his inscription, or scripture. That is a 'Book'....</p>

<p>Now books of this kind have been written in all ages by
their greatest men:&mdash;by great leaders, great statesmen, and
great thinkers. These are all at your choice; and life is
short. You have heard as much before; yet have you
measured and mapped out this short life and its possibilities?
Do you know, if you read this, that you cannot read that&mdash;that
what you lose to-day you cannot gain to-morrow?
Will you go and gossip with your housemaid, or your
stable-boy, when you may talk with queens and kings;
or flatter yourselves that it is with any worthy consciousness
of your own claims to respect that you jostle with the
common crowd for <i>entrée</i> here, and audience there, when
all the while this eternal court is open to you, with its
society wide as the world, multitudinous as its days, the
chosen, and the mighty, of every place and time? Into
that you may enter always; in that you may take fellowship
and rank according to your wish; from that, once
entered into it, you can never be outcast but by your own
fault; by your aristocracy of companionship there, your
own inherent aristocracy will be assuredly tested, and the
motives with which you strive to take high place in the
society of the living, measured, as to all the truth and
sincerity that are in them, by the place you desire to take
in this company of the Dead.&mdash;<span class="smcap">J. Ruskin.</span> <i>Sesame and

<h3>THE MULTIPLICITY OF BOOKS</h3>

<p>Solomon saith truly, Of making many books there is no
end, so insatiable is the thirst of men therein; as also endless
is the desire of many in buying and reading them. But
we come to our rules.</p>

<p>1. <i>It is a vanity to persuade the world one hath much
learning, by getting a great library.</i> As soon shall I believe
every one is valiant that hath a well-furnished armoury.
I guess good housekeeping by the smoking, not the number
of the tunnels, as knowing that many of them, built merely
for uniformity, are without chimneys, and more without
fires. Once a dunce void of learning but full of books flouted
a libraryless scholar with these words: <i>Salve doctor sine
libris.</i> But the next day the scholar coming into this
jeerer's study, crowded with books; <i>Salvete libri</i>, saith he,
<i>sine doctore</i>.</p>

<p>2. <i>Few books, well selected, are best.</i> Yet, as a certain fool
bought all the pictures that came out, because he might have
his choice, such is the vain humour of many men in gathering
of books: yet when they have done all, they miss their
end, it being in the editions of authors as in the fashions of
clothes, when a man thinks he hath gotten the latest and
newest, presently another newer comes out.</p>

<p>3. <i>Some books are only cursorily to be tasted of.</i> Namely,
first, voluminous books, the task of a man's life to read them
over; secondly, auxiliary books, only to be repaired to on
occasions; thirdly, such as are mere pieces of formality, so
that if you look on them, you look through them; and he
that peeps through the casement of the index sees as much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
as if he were in the house. But the laziness of those cannot
be excused who perfunctorily pass over authors of consequence,
and only trade in their tables and contents. These,
like city-cheaters, having gotten the names of all country
gentlemen, make silly people believe they have long lived
in those places where they never were, and flourish with
skill in those authors they never seriously studied.</p>

<p>4. <i>The genius of the author is commonly discovered in the
dedicatory epistle.</i> Many place the purest grain in the mouth
of the sack for chapmen to handle or buy: and from the
dedication one may probably guess at the work, saving
some rare and peculiar exceptions. Thus, when once
a gentleman admired how so pithy, learned, and witty
a dedication was matched to a flat, dull, foolish book; <i>In
truth</i>, said another, <i>they may be well matched together, for
I profess they are nothing akin</i>.</p>

<p>5. <i>Proportion an hour's meditation to an hour's reading
of a staple author.</i> This makes a man master of his learning,
and dispirits the book into the scholar. The king of
Sweden never filed his men above six deep in one company,
because he would not have them lie in useless clusters in
his army, but so that every particular soldier might be
drawn out into service. Books that stand thin on the shelves,
yet so as the owner of them can bring forth every one of
them into use, are better than far greater libraries....</p>

<p>But what do I, speaking against multiplicity of books in
this age, who trespass in this nature myself? What was
a learned man's compliment, may serve for my confession
and conclusion: <i>Multi mei similes hoc morbo laborant, ut
cum scribere nesciant tamen a scribendo temperare non possint</i>.&mdash;<span class="smcap">T.
Fuller.</span> <i>The Holy State and the Profane State.</i></p>


<h3>SUPERFLUOUS BOOKS</h3>

<p>I have heard some with deep sighs lament the lost lines
of Cicero; others with as many groans deplore the combustion
of the library of Alexandria. For my own part,
I think there be too many in the world, and could with
patience behold the urn and ashes of the Vatican, could I,
with a few others, recover the perished leaves of Solomon.
I would not omit a copy of <i>Enoch's Pillars</i>, had they many
nearer authors than Josephus, or did not relish somewhat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
of the fable. Some men have written more than others
have spoken. Pineda quotes more authors in one work
than are necessary in a whole world. Of those three great
inventions in Germany, there are two which are not without
their incommodities, and 'tis disputable whether they
exceed not their use and commodities. 'Tis not a melancholy
<i>Utinam</i> of mine own, but the desires of better heads
that there were a general synod; not to unite the incompatible
differences of religion, but for the benefit of learning,
to reduce it as it lay at first, in a few and solid authors;
and to condemn to the fire those swarms and millions of
rhapsodies, begotten only to distract and abuse the weaker
judgements of scholars, and to maintain the trade and
mystery of typographers.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Sir T. Browne.</span> <i>Religio Medici.</i></p>


<h3>MULTIPLICATION IS VEXATION</h3>

<p>The reason that books are multiplied, in spite of the
general law that beings shall not be multiplied without
necessity, is, that books are made from books. A new
history of France or Spain is manufactured from several
volumes already printed, without adding anything new.
All dictionaries are made from dictionaries; almost all new
geographical books are made from other books of geography;
St. Thomas's dream has brought forth two thousand large
volumes of divinity; and the same race of little worms
that have devoured the parent are now gnawing the children.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Voltaire.</span>
<i>Philosophical Dictionary: Books.</i></p>


<h3>THE MULTIPLICATION OF ORIGINALS</h3>

<p>The invention of printing has not, perhaps, multiplied
books, but only the copies of them; and if we believe there
were six hundred thousand in the library of Ptolemy, we
shall hardly pretend to equal it by any of ours, nor, perhaps,
by all put together; I mean so many originals that have
lived any time, and thereby given testimony to their having
been thought worth preserving. For the scribblers are
infinite, that like mushrooms or flies are born and die in
small circles of time; whereas books, like proverbs, receive
their chief value from the stamp and esteem of ages through
which they have passed.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Sir W. Temple.</span> <i>Ancient and
Modern Learning.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>


<h3>THE AUTHORS' ADVANTAGE</h3>

<p>The circumstance which gives authors an advantage ...
is this, that they can multiply their originals; or rather can
make copies of their works, to what number they please,
which shall be as valuable as the originals themselves.
This gives a great author something like a prospect of
eternity, but at the same time deprives him of those other
advantages which artists meet with. The artist finds
greater returns in profit, as the author in fame. What an
inestimable price would a Virgil or a Homer, a Cicero or
an Aristotle bear, were their works like a statue, a building,
or a picture, to be confined only in one place, and made the
property of a single person!&mdash;<span class="smcap">J. Addison.</span> <i>Spectator</i>, 166.</p>


<h3>AN IGNORANT AGE HATH MANY BOOKS</h3>

<p>It is observed that <i>a corrupt society has many laws</i>;
I know not whether it is not equally true, that <i>an ignorant
age has many books</i>. When the treasures of ancient knowledge
lie unexamined, and original authors are neglected
and forgotten, compilers and plagiaries are encouraged
who give us again what we had before, and grow great by
setting before us what our own sloth had hidden from our
view.&mdash;<span class="smcap">S. Johnson.</span> <i>Idler</i>, 85.</p>


<h3>THE DIFFUSION OF BOOKS AND ITS EFFECT ON CULTURE</h3>

<p>Nothing can supply the place of books. They are
cheering or soothing companions in solitude, illness, affliction.
The wealth of both continents would not compensate for
the good they impart. Let every man, if possible, gather
some good books under his roof, and obtain access for himself
and family to some social library. Almost any luxury
should be sacrificed to this.</p>

<p>One of the very interesting features of our times is the
multiplication of books, and their distribution through all
conditions of society. At a small expense a man can now
possess himself of the most precious treasures of English
literature. Books, once confined to a few by their costliness,
are now accessible to the multitude; and in this way
a change of habits is going on in society, highly favourable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
to the culture of the people. Instead of depending on
casual rumour and loose conversation for most of their
knowledge and objects of thought; instead of forming
their judgements in crowds, and receiving their chief excitement
from the voice of neighbours; men are now learning
to study and reflect alone, to follow out subjects continuously,
to determine for themselves what shall engage
their minds, and to call to their aid the knowledge, original
views, and reasonings of men of all countries and ages; and
the results must be, a deliberateness and independence of
judgement, and a thoroughness and extent of information,
unknown in former times. The diffusion of these silent
teachers, books, through the whole community, is to work
greater effects than artillery, machinery, and legislation.
Its peaceful agency is to supersede stormy revolutions.
The culture, which is to spread, whilst an unspeakable
good to the individual, is also to become the stability of
nations.&mdash;<span class="smcap">W. E. Channing.</span> <i>Self-Culture.</i></p>


<h3>THE DISTRACTION OF CHOICE</h3>

<p>Under our present enormous accumulation of books,
I do affirm, that a miserable distraction of choice (which
is the germ of such a madness) must be very generally
incident to the times; that the symptoms of it are, in fact,
very prevalent; and that one of the chief symptoms is an
enormous 'gluttonism' for books, and for adding language
to language; and in this way it is that literature becomes
much more a source of torment than of pleasure. Nay,
I will go further, and will say that of many, who escape this
disease, some owe their privilege simply to the narrowness
of their minds and the contracted range of their sympathies
with literature&mdash;which enlarged, they would soon lose it!
others, again, owe it to their situation; as, for instance, in
a country town, where, books being few, a man can use up
all his materials, his appetite is unpalled&mdash;and he is grateful
for the loan of a MS., &amp;c.: but bring him up to London&mdash;show
him the wagon-loads of unused stores&mdash;which he is at liberty
to work up&mdash;tell him that these even are but a trifle, perhaps,
to what he may find in the libraries of Paris, Dresden,
Milan, &amp;c.&mdash;of religious houses&mdash;of English noblemen, &amp;c.;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
and this same man, who came up to London blithe and
happy, will leave it pale and sad. You have ruined his
peace of mind: a subject which he fancied himself capable
of exhausting, he finds to be a labour for centuries: he has
no longer the healthy pleasure of feeling himself master of
his materials; he is degraded into their slave.&mdash;<span class="smcap">T. De
Quincey.</span> <i>Letters to a Young Man.</i></p>

<h3>A LIBRARY OF TWELVE</h3>

<p>You may get the whole of Sir Thomas Browne's works
more easily than the <i>Hydrotaphia</i> in a single form....
If I were confined to a score of English books, this I think
would be one of them; nay, probably, it would be one
if the selection were cut down to twelve. My library, if
reduced to those bounds, would consist of Shakespeare,
Chaucer, Spenser, and Milton; Lord Clarendon; Jackson,
Jeremy Taylor, and South; Isaac Walton, Sidney's <i>Arcadia</i>,
Fuller's <i>Church History</i>, and Sir Thomas Browne; and what
a wealthy and well-stored mind would that man have,
what an inexhaustible reservoir, what a Bank of England
to draw upon for profitable thoughts and delightful associations,
who should have fed upon them.&mdash;<span class="smcap">R. Southey</span>
(Letter to G. C. Bedford).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>


<h3>ANCIENT AND MODERN BOOKS</h3>

<p>Whoever converses much among the old books will be
something hard to please among the new; yet these must
have their part, too, in the leisure of an idle man, and have,
many of them, their beauties as well as their defaults.
Those of story, or relations of matter of fact, have a value
from their substance as much as from their form, and the
variety of events is seldom without entertainment or
instruction, how indifferently soever the tale is told. Other
sorts of writings have little of esteem but what they receive
from the wit, learning, or genius of the authors, and are
seldom met with of any excellency, because they do but
trace over the paths that have been beaten by the ancients,
or comment, critic, and flourish upon them, and are at best
but copies after those originals, unless upon subjects never
touched by them, such as are all that relate to the different
constitutions of religions, laws, or governments in several
countries, with all matters of controversy that arise upon
them.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Sir W. Temple.</span> <i>Ancient and Modern Learning.</i></p>


<h3>THE BATTLE OF THE BOOKS</h3>

<p>Immediately the two main bodies withdrew, under their
several ensigns, to the farther parts of the library, and there
entered into cabals and consults upon the present emergency.
The Moderns were in very warm debates upon the choice of
their leaders; and nothing less than the fear impending
from their enemies could have kept them from mutinies
upon this occasion. The difference was greatest among the
horse, where every private trooper pretended to the chief
command, from Tasso and Milton to Dryden and Wither.
The light-horse were commanded by Cowley and Despreaux.
There came the bowmen under their valiant leaders,
Descartes, Gassendi, and Hobbes; whose strength was
such that they could shoot their arrows beyond the atmosphere,
never to fall down again, but turn, like that of
Evander, into meteors; or, like the cannon-ball, into stars.
Paracelsus brought a squadron of stinkpot-flingers from the
snowy mountains of Rhaetia. There came a vast body of
dragoons, of different nations, under the leading of Harvey,
their great aga: part armed with scythes, the weapons of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
death; part with lances and long knives, all steeped in
poison; part shot bullets of a most malignant nature, and
used white powder, which infallibly killed without report.
There came several bodies of heavy-armed foot, all mercenaries,
under the ensigns of Guiccardini, Davila, Polydore,
Virgil, Buchanan, Mariana, Camden, and others. The
engineers were commanded by Regiomontanus and Wilkins.
The rest was a confused multitude, led by Scotus, Aquinas,
and Bellarmine; of mighty bulk and stature, but without
either arms, courage, or discipline. In the last place
came infinite swarms of calones, a disorderly rout led by
L'Estrange; rogues and ragamuffins, that follow the camp
for nothing but the plunder, all without coats to cover them.</p>

<p>The Army of the Ancients was much fewer in number;
Homer led the horse, and Pindar the light-horse; Euclid
was chief engineer; Plato and Aristotle commanded the
bowmen; Herodotus and Livy the foot; Hippocrates, the
dragoons; the allies, led by Vossius and Temple, brought
up the rear.</p>

<p>All things violently tending to a decisive battle, Fame,
who much frequented, and had a large apartment assigned
her in the regal library, fled up straight to Jupiter, to whom
she delivered a faithful account of all that passed between
the two parties below; for among the Gods she always
tells truth. Jove, in great concern, convokes a council in the
Milky Way. The senate assembled, he declares the occasion
of convening them; a bloody battle just impendent between
two mighty armies of ancient and modern creatures, called
books, wherein the celestial interest was but too deeply
concerned. Momus, the patron of the Moderns, made an
excellent speech in their favour, which was answered by
Pallas, the protectress of the Ancients. The assembly was
divided in their affections; when Jupiter commanded the
Book of Fate to be laid before him. Immediately were
brought by Mercury three large volumes in folio, containing
memoirs of all things past, present, and to come. The
clasps were of silver double gilt, the covers of celestial
turkey leather, and the paper such as here on earth might
almost pass for vellum. Jupiter, having silently read the
decree, would communicate the import to none, but presently
shut up the book....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>Meanwhile Momus, fearing the worst, and calling to mind
an ancient prophecy which bore no very good face to his
children the Moderns, bent his flight to the region of a
malignant deity called Criticism. She dwelt on the top of
a snowy mountain in Nova Zembla; there Momus found
her extended in her den, upon the spoils of numberless
volumes, half devoured. At her right hand sat Ignorance,
her father and husband, blind with age; at her left, Pride,
her mother, dressing her up in the scraps of paper herself
had torn. There was Opinion, her sister, light of foot, hoodwinked,
and headstrong, yet giddy and perpetually turning.
About her played her children, Noise and Impudence,
Dullness and Vanity, Positiveness, Pedantry, and Ill-manners....
'Goddess,' said Momus, 'can you sit idly here
while our devout worshippers, the Moderns, are this minute
entering into a cruel battle, and perhaps now lying under
the swords of their enemies? Who then hereafter will ever
sacrifice or build altars to our divinities? Haste, therefore,
to the British Isle, and, if possible, prevent their destruction;
while I make factions among the gods, and gain them over
to our party.' ...</p>

<p>The goddess and her train, having mounted the chariot,
which was drawn by tame geese, flew over infinite regions,
shedding her influence in due places, till at length she
arrived at her beloved island of Britain; but in hovering
over its metropolis, what blessings did she not let fall upon
her seminaries of Gresham and Covent Garden! And now
she reached the fatal plain of St. James's library, at what
time the two armies were upon the point to engage; where,
entering with all her caravan unseen, and landing upon
a case of shelves, now desert, but once inhabited by a colony
of virtuosos, she stayed awhile to observe the posture of
both armies.&mdash;<span class="smcap">J. Swift.</span> <i>The Battle of the Books.</i></p>


<h3>OLD AUTHORS TO READ</h3>

<p>Alonso of Aragon was wont to say, in commendation
of Age, that Age appeared to be best in four things; Old
wood best to burn, old wine to drink, old friends to trust,
and old authors to read.&mdash;<span class="smcap">F. Bacon, Lord Verulam.</span>
<i>Apophthegmes.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>


<h3>CLASSICUS</h3>

<p>Classicus is a man of learning, and well versed in all the
best authors of antiquity. He has read them so much that
he has entered into their spirit, and can very ingeniously
imitate the manner of any of them. All their thoughts are
his thoughts, and he can express himself in their language.
He is so great a friend to this improvement of the mind
that if he lights on a young scholar he never fails to advise
him concerning his studies.</p>

<p>Classicus tells his young man he must not think that he has
done enough when he has only learnt languages; but that
he must be daily conversant with the best authors, read
them again and again, catch their spirit by living with
them, and that there is no other way of becoming like them,
or of making himself a man of taste and judgement.</p>

<p>How wise might Classicus have been and how much good
might he have done in the world, if he had but thought as
justly of devotion as he does of learning!... The two
testaments would not have had so much as a place amongst
his books, but that they are both to be had in Greek.</p>

<p>Classicus thinks that he sufficiently shows his regard for
the holy scriptures when he tells you that he has no other
book of piety besides them.&mdash;<span class="smcap">W. Law.</span> <i>A serious Call to
a devout and holy Life.</i></p>

<h3>THE MOONS OF LITERATURE</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>, ... we must read what the world reads at the moment.
It has been maintained that this superfoetation, this teeming
of the press in modern times, is prejudicial to good literature,
because it obliges us to read so much of what is of inferior
value, in order to be in the fashion; so that better works
are neglected for want of time, because a man will have
more gratification of his vanity in conversation, from having
read modern books than from having read the best books of
antiquity. But it must be considered, that we have now
more knowledge generally diffused; all our ladies read now,
which is a great extension. Modern writers are the moons
of literature; they shine with reflected light, with light
borrowed from the ancients. Greece appears to me to be
the fountain of knowledge; Rome of elegance.&mdash;<span class="smcap">S. Johnson.</span>
(Boswell's <i>Life</i>.)</p>


<h3>THE READING OF NEW BOOKS</h3>

<blockquote>

<p>From Lien Chi Altangi to Fum Hoam, First President of the
Ceremonial Academy at Pekin, in China</p></blockquote>

<p>There are numbers in this city who live by writing new
books; and yet there are thousands of volumes in every
large library unread and forgotten. This, upon my arrival,
was one of those contradictions which I was unable to
account for. Is it possible, said I, that there should be any
demand for new books before those already published are
read? Can there be so many employed in producing a
commodity with which the market is overstocked; and
with goods also better than any of modern manufacture!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>What at first view appeared an inconsistency is a proof at
once of this people's wisdom and refinement. Even allowing
the works of their ancestors better written than theirs, yet
those of the moderns acquire a real value, by being marked
with the impression of the times. Antiquity has been in
the possession of others; the present is our own: let us first
therefore learn to know what belongs to ourselves, and
then, if we have leisure, cast our reflections back to the reign
of Shonsu, who governed twenty thousand years before the
creation of the moon.</p>

<p>The volumes of antiquity, like medals, may very well serve
to amuse the curious; but the works of the moderns, like
the current coin of a kingdom, are much better for immediate
use; the former are often prized above their intrinsic
value, and kept with care, the latter seldom pass for more
than they are worth, and are often subject to the merciless
hands of sweating critics and clipping compilers: the works
of antiquity were ever praised, those of the moderns read;
the treasures of our ancestors have our esteem, and we boast
the passion; those of contemporary genius engage our
heart, although we blush to own it. The visits we pay the
former resemble those we pay the great; the ceremony is
troublesome, and yet such as we would not choose to forgo;
our acquaintance with modern books is like sitting with
a friend; our pride is not flattered in the interview, but it
gives more internal satisfaction....</p>

<p>In England, where there are as many new books published
as in all the rest of Europe together, a spirit of
freedom and reason reigns among the people; they have
been often known to act like fools, they are generally found
to think like men.&mdash;<span class="smcap">O. Goldsmith.</span> <i>Letters from a Citizen
of the World.</i></p>


<h3>THE CLASSICS ALWAYS MODERN</h3>

<p>In science read, by preference, the newest works; in literature,
the oldest. The classic literature is always modern.
New books revive and re-decorate old ideas; old books
suggest and invigorate new ideas.&mdash;<span class="smcap">E. G. E. L. Bulwer-Lytton,
Lord Lytton.</span> <i>Caxtoniana.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>


<h3>ON READING OLD BOOKS</h3>

<p>I hate to read new books. There are twenty or thirty
volumes that I have read over and over again, and these
are the only ones that I have any desire ever to read at all.
It was a long time before I could bring myself to sit down
to the <i>Tales of My Landlord</i>, but now that author's works
have made a considerable addition to my scanty library....
Women judge of books as they do of fashions or complexions,
which are admired only 'in their newest gloss'.
That is not my way. I am not one of those who trouble the
circulating libraries much, or pester the booksellers for
mail-coach copies of standard periodical publications. I
cannot say that I am greatly addicted to black-letter, but
I profess myself well versed in the marble bindings of
Andrew Millar, in the middle of the last century; nor does
my taste revolt at Thurloe's <i>State Papers</i>, in russia leather;
or an ample impression of Sir William Temple's <i>Essays</i>,
with a portrait after Sir Godfrey Kneller in front. I do not
think altogether the worse of a book for having survived
the author a generation or two. I have more confidence in
the dead than the living.... When I take up a work that
I have read before (the oftener the better), I know what
I have to expect. The satisfaction is not lessened by being
anticipated. When the entertainment is altogether new,
I sit down to it as I should to a strange dish&mdash;turn and pick
out a bit here and there, and am in doubt what to think of
the composition. There is a want of confidence and security
to second appetite. New-fangled books are also like made-dishes
in this respect, that they are generally little else than
hashes and <i>rifaccimentos</i> of what has been served up entire
and in a more natural state at other times. Besides, in
thus turning to a well-known author, there is not only an
assurance that my time will not be thrown away, or my
palate nauseated with the most insipid or vilest trash, but
I shake hands with, and look an old, tried, and valued
friend in the face, compare notes, and chat the hours away.
It is true, we form dear friendships with such ideal guests&mdash;dearer,
alas! and more lasting, than those with our most
intimate acquaintance. In reading a book which is an old
favourite with me (say the first novel I ever read) I not only
have the pleasure of imagination and of a critical relish of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
the work, but the pleasures of memory added to it. It
recalls the same feelings and associations which I had in
first reading it, and which I can never have again in any
other way. Standard productions of this kind are links in
the chain of our conscious being. They bind together the
different scattered divisions of our personal identity. They
are landmarks and guides in our journey through life. They
are pegs and loops on which we can hang up, or from which
we can take down, at pleasure, the wardrobe of a moral
imagination, the relics of our best affections, the tokens and
records of our happiest hours. They are 'for thoughts and
for remembrance'! They are like Fortunatus's Wishing
Cap&mdash;they give us the best riches&mdash;those of Fancy; and
transport us, not over half the globe, but (which is better)
over half our lives, at a word's notice!</p>

<p>My father Shandy solaced himself with Bruscambille.
Give me for this purpose a volume of <i>Peregrine Pickle</i> or
<i>Tom Jones</i>. Open either of them anywhere&mdash;at the memoirs
of Lady Vane, or the adventures at the masquerade with
Lady Bellaston, or the disputes between Thwackum and
Square, or the escape of Molly Seagrim, or the incident of
Sophia and her muff, or the edifying prolixity of her aunt's
lecture&mdash;and there I find the same delightful, busy, bustling
scene as ever, and feel myself the same as when I was first
introduced into the midst of it. Nay, sometimes the sight
of an odd volume of these good old English authors on a
stall, or the name lettered on the back among others on the
shelves of a library, answers the purpose, revives the whole
train of ideas, and sets 'the puppets dallying'. Twenty
years are struck off the list, and I am a child again. A sage
philosopher, who was not a very wise man, said, that he
should like very well to be young again, if he could take his
experience along with him. This ingenious person did not
seem to be aware, by the gravity of his remark, that the
great advantage of being young is to be without this weight
of experience, which he would fain place upon the shoulders
of youth, and which never comes too late with years. Oh!
what a privilege to be able to let this hump, like Christian's
burthen, drop from off one's back, and transport oneself, by
the help of a little musty duodecimo, to the time when
'ignorance was bliss', and when we first got a peep at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
raree-show of the world, through the glass of fiction&mdash;gazing
at mankind, as we do at wild beasts in a menagerie,
through the bars of their cages&mdash;or at curiosities in a
museum, that we must not touch! For myself, not only
are the old ideas of the contents of the work brought back
to my mind in all their vividness, but the old associations
of the faces and persons of those I then knew, as they were
in their lifetime&mdash;the place where I sat to read the volume,
the day when I got it, the feeling of the air, the fields, the
sky&mdash;return, and all my early impressions with them. This
is better to me&mdash;those places, those times, those persons,
and those feelings that come across me as I retrace the story
and devour the page, are to me better far than the wet
sheets of the last new novel.&mdash;<span class="smcap">W. Hazlitt.</span> <i>The Plain
Speaker.</i></p>


<h3>ON READING NEW BOOKS</h3>

<p>I cannot understand the rage manifested by the greater
part of the world for reading new books. If the public had
read all those that have gone before, I can conceive how
they should not wish to read the same work twice over;
but when I consider the countless volumes that lie unopened,
unregarded, unread, and unthought of, I cannot enter into
the pathetic complaints that I hear made that Sir Walter
writes no more&mdash;that the press is idle&mdash;that Lord Byron is
dead. If I have not read a book before, it is, to all intents
and purposes, new to me, whether it was printed yesterday
or three hundred years ago. If it be urged that it has no
modern, passing incidents, and is out of date and old-fashioned,
then it is so much the newer; it is farther
removed from other works that I have lately read, from the
familiar routine of ordinary life, and makes so much more
addition to my knowledge. But many people would as soon
think of putting on old armour as of taking up a book not
published within the last month, or year at the utmost.
There is a fashion in reading as well as in dress, which lasts
only for the season. One would imagine that books were,
like women, the worse for being old; that they have
a pleasure in being read for the first time; that they open
their leaves more cordially; that the spirit of enjoyment
wears out with the spirit of novelty; and that, after a certain
age, it is high time to put them on the shelf. This conceit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
seems to be followed up in practice.... The knowledge
which so many other persons have of its contents deadens
our curiosity and interest altogether. We set aside the
subject as one on which others have made up their minds
for us (as if we really could have ideas in their heads), and
are quite on the alert for the next new work, teeming hot
from the press, which we shall be the first to read, criticize,
and pass an opinion on. Oh, delightful! To cut open the
leaves, to inhale the fragrance of the scarcely dry paper, to
examine the type to see who is the printer (which is some
clue to the value that is set upon the work), to launch out
into regions of thought and invention never trod till now,
and to explore characters that never met a human eye
before&mdash;this is a luxury worth sacrificing a dinner-party,
or a few hours of a spare morning to. Who, indeed, when
the work is critical and full of expectation, would venture
to dine out, or to face a coterie of blue-stockings in the
evening, without having gone through this ordeal, or at
least without hastily turning over a few of the first pages,
while dressing, to be able to say that the beginning does
not promise much, or to tell the name of the heroine?</p>

<p>A new work is something in our power: we mount the
bench, and sit in judgement on it; we can damn or recommend
it to others at pleasure, can decry or extol it to the
skies, and can give an answer to those who have not yet
read it, and expect an account of it; and thus show our
shrewdness and the independence of our taste before the
world have had time to form an opinion. If we cannot
write ourselves, we become, by busying ourselves about it,
a kind of <i>accessories after the fact</i>.&mdash;<span class="smcap">W. Hazlitt.</span> <i>Sketches
and Essays.</i></p>


<h3>A PREFERENCE FOR GREAT MODELS</h3>

<p>By the by, I observe a point in which your taste and
mine differ from each other materially. It is about new
publications. I read them unwillingly. You abstain from
them with difficulty, and as a matter of duty and self-denial.
Their novelty has very little attraction for me; and
in literature I am fond of confining myself to the best
company, which consists chiefly of my old acquaintance,
with whom I am desirous of becoming more intimate; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
I suspect that nine times out of ten it is more profitable,
if not more agreeable, to read an old book over again,
than to read a new one for the first time. If I hear of
a new poem, for instance, I ask myself first, whether it is
superior to Homer, Shakespeare, Ariosto, Virgil, or Racine;
and, in the next place, whether I already have all these
authors completely at my fingers' ends. And when both
questions have been answered in the negative, I infer that
it is better (and, to me, it is certainly pleasanter) to give
such time as I have to bestow on the reading of poetry to
Homer, Ariosto and Co., and so of other things.</p>

<p>Is it not better to try, at least, to elevate and adorn
one's mind, by the constant study and contemplation of
the great models, than merely to know of one's own knowledge
that such a book an't worth reading?&mdash;<span class="smcap">J. W. Ward,
Earl of Dudley</span> (Letter to the Bishop of Llandaff).</p>


<h3>THE VALUE OF MODERN BOOKS</h3>

<p>The great productions of Athenian and Roman genius
are indeed still what they were. But though their positive
value is unchanged, their relative value, when compared
with the whole mass of mental wealth possessed by mankind,
has been constantly falling. They were the intellectual
all of our ancestors. They are but a part of our treasures.
Over what tragedy could Lady Jane Grey have wept,
over what comedy could she have smiled, if the ancient
dramatists had not been in her library? A modern reader
can make shift without <i>Oedipus</i> and <i>Medea</i>, while he
possesses <i>Othello</i> and <i>Hamlet</i>. If he knows nothing of
<i>Pyrgopolynices</i> and <i>Thraso</i>, he is familiar with <i>Bobadil</i>, and
<i>Bessus</i>, and <i>Pistol</i>, and <i>Parolles</i>. If he cannot enjoy the
delicious irony of Plato, he may find some compensation
in that of Pascal. If he is shut out from <i>Nephelococcygia</i>,
he may take refuge in <i>Lilliput</i>.... We believe that the
books which have been written in the languages of Western
Europe, during the last two hundred and fifty years&mdash;translations
from the ancient languages of course included,&mdash;are
of greater value than all the books which at the beginning
of that period were extant in the world.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Lord
Macaulay.</span> <i>Lord Bacon.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>


<h3>A SORT OF THIRD ESTATE</h3>

<p>Each age, it is found, must write its own books; or,
rather, each generation for the next succeeding. The books
of an older period will not fit this. Yet hence arises a grave
mischief. The sacredness which attaches to the act of
creation&mdash;the act of thought&mdash;is transferred to the record.
The poet chanting, was felt to be a divine man: henceforth
the chant is divine also. The writer was a just and
wise spirit: henceforward it is settled, the book is perfect;
as love of the hero corrupts into worship of his statue.
Instantly, the book becomes noxious: the guide is a tyrant.
The sluggish and perverted mind of the multitude, slow to
open to the incursions of Reason, having once so opened,
having once received this book, stands upon it, and makes
an outcry if it is disparaged. Colleges are built on it.
Books are written on it by thinkers, not by Man Thinking;
by men of talent, that is, who start wrong, who set out
from accepted dogmas, not from their own sight of principles.
Meek young men grow up in libraries, believing it their
duty to accept the views which Cicero, which Locke, which
Bacon, have given, forgetful that Cicero, Locke, and Bacon
were only young men in libraries when they wrote these
books.</p>

<p>Hence, instead of Man Thinking, we have the book-worm.
Hence, the book-learned class, who value books as such;
not as related to nature and the human constitution, but
as making a sort of Third Estate with the world and the
soul. Hence, the restorers of readings, the emendators, the
bibliomaniacs of all degrees.</p>

<p>Books are the best of things, well used; abused, among
the worst.&mdash;<span class="smcap">R. W. Emerson.</span> <i>The American Scholar.</i></p>


<h3>OLD AND NEW BOOKS</h3>

<p>Old books, as you well know, are books of the world's
youth, and new books are fruits of its age. How many of all
these ancient folios round me are like so many old cupels?
The gold has passed out of these long ago, but their pores
are full of the dross with which it was mingled.&mdash;<span class="smcap">O. W.
Holmes.</span> <i>The Professor at the Breakfast-Table.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>


<h3>SECURITY IN OLD BOOKS</h3>

<p>What a sense of security in an old book which Time has
criticized for us! What a precious feeling of seclusion in
having a double wall of centuries between us and the heats
and clamours of contemporary literature! How limpid
seems the thought, how pure the old wine of scholarship
that has been settling for so many generations in those
silent crypts and Falernian <i>amphorae</i> of the Past! No other
writers speak to us with the authority of those whose
ordinary speech was that of our translation of the Scriptures;
to no modern is that frank unconsciousness possible
which was natural to a period when reviews were not; and
no later style breathes that country charm characteristic of
days ere the metropolis drew all literary activity to itself,
and the trampling feet of the multitude had banished the
lark and the daisy from the fresh privacies of language.
Truly, as compared with the present, these old voices seem
to come from the morning fields and not the paved thoroughfares
of thought....</p>

<p>There are volumes which have the old age of Plato,
rich with gathering experience, meditation, and wisdom,
which seem to have sucked colour and ripeness from the
genial autumns of all the select intelligences that have
steeped them in the sunshine of their love and appreciation;&mdash;these
quaint freaks of russet tell of Montaigne;
these stripes of crimson fire, of Shakespeare; this sober
gold, of Sir Thomas Browne; this purpling bloom, of
Lamb;&mdash;in such fruits we taste the legendary gardens of
Alcinoüs and the orchards of Atlas; and there are volumes
again which can claim only the inglorious senility of Old
Parr or older Jenkins, which have outlived their half-dozen
of kings to be the prize of showmen and treasuries of the
born-to-be-forgotten trifles of a hundred years ago....</p>

<p>There is to us a sacredness in a volume, however dull;
we live over again the author's lonely labours and tremulous
hopes; we see him, on his first appearance after parturition,
'as well as could be expected,' a nervous sympathy yet
surviving between the late-severed umbilical cord and the
wondrous offspring, doubtfully entering the Mermaid, or
the Devil Tavern, or the Coffee-house of Will or Button,
blushing under the eye of Ben or Dryden or Addison, as if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
they must needs know him for the author of the <i>Modest
Enquiry into the Present State of Dramatique Poetry</i>, or of
the <i>Unities briefly considered by Philomusus</i>, of which they
have never heard and never will so much as hear the names;
we see the country-gentlemen (sole cause of its surviving to
our day) who buy it as a book no gentleman's library can be
complete without; we see the spendthrift heir, whose
horses and hounds and Pharaonic troops of friends, drowned
in a Red Sea of claret, bring it to the hammer, the tall
octavo in tree-calf following the ancestral oaks of the park.
Such a volume is sacred to us. But it must be the original
foundling of the book-stall, the engraved blazon of some
extinct baronetcy within its cover, its leaves enshrining
memorial-flowers of some passion smothered while the
Stuarts were not yet unkinged, suggestive of the trail of laced
ruffles, burnt here and there with ashes from the pipe of
some dozing poet, its binding worn and weather-stained,
that has felt the inquisitive finger, perhaps, of Malone, or
thrilled to the touch of Lamb, doubtful between desire and
the odd sixpence. When it comes to a question of reprinting
we are more choice. The new duodecimo is bald and
bare, indeed, compared with its battered prototype that
could draw us with a single hair of association.&mdash;<span class="smcap">J. R.

<h3>BOOKS THAT DO HURT</h3>

<p>In our forefathers' time, when papistry, as a standing
pool, covered and overflowed all England, few books were
read in our tongue, saving certain books of chivalry, as
they said for pastime and pleasure; which, as some say,
were made in monasteries by idle monks or wanton canons.
As one for example, 'Morte Arthur', the whole pleasure of
which book standeth in two special points, in open manslaughter
and bold bawdry.... This is good stuff for wise
men to laugh at, or honest men to take pleasure at: yet
I know, when God's Bible was banished the court, and
'Morte Arthur' received into the prince's chamber.</p>

<p>What toys the daily reading of such a book may work
in the will of a young gentleman, or a young maid, that
liveth wealthily or idly, wise men can judge, and honest
men do pity. And yet ten 'Morte Arthurs' do not the tenth
part so much harm, as one of these books made in Italy
and translated in England.... Suffer these books to be
read, and they shall soon displace all books of godly
learning.&mdash;<span class="smcap">R. Ascham.</span> <i>The Schoolmaster.</i></p>

<h3>MOUNTEBANK AUTHORS</h3>

<p>They [the Stationers] have so pestered their printing-houses
and shops with fruitless volumes that the ancient
and renowned authors are almost buried among them as
forgotten; and that they have so much work to prefer
their termly pamphlets, which they provide to take up the
people's money and time, that there is neither of them
left to bestow on a profitable book: so they who desire
knowledge are still kept ignorant; their ignorance in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>creaseth
their affection to vain toys; their affection makes
the stationer to increase his provision of such stuff, and at
last you shall see nothing to be sold amongst us but
Curranto's <i>Bevis of Southampton</i> or such trumpery. The Arts
are already almost lost among the writings of mountebank
authors. For if any one among us would study Physic,
the Mathematics, Poetry, or any of the liberal sciences,
they have in their warehouses so many volumes of quack-salving
receipts; of false propositions; and of inartificial
rhymings (of which last sort they have some of mine there,
God forgive me!) that unless we be directed by some artist,
we shall spend half our age before we can find those authors
which are worth our readings. For what need the stationer
be at the charge of printing the labours of him that is
master of his art, and will require that respect which his
pain deserveth, seeing he can hire for a matter of forty
shillings some needy ignoramus to scribble upon the same
subject, and by a large promising title, make it as vendible
for an impression or two, as though it had the quintessence
of all art?&mdash;<span class="smcap">G. Wither.</span> <i>The Scholler's Purgatory.</i></p>


<h3>PRINTERS GAIN BY BAD BOOKS</h3>

<p><i>Learning hath gained most by those books by which the
printers have lost.</i> Arius Montanus, in printing the Hebrew
Bible, commonly called the Bible of the king of Spain, much
wasted himself, and was accused in the court of Rome for
his good deed, and being cited thither, <i>Pro tantorum laborum
praemio vix veniam impetravit</i>. Likewise Christopher
Plantin, by printing of his curious interlineary Bible in
Antwerp, through the unseasonable exactions of the king's
officers, sunk and almost ruined his estate. And our
worthy English knight, who set forth the golden-mouthed
father in a silver print, was a loser by it.</p>

<p><i>Whereas foolish pamphlets prove most beneficial to the
printers.</i> When a French printer complained that he was
utterly undone by printing a solid serious book of Rabelais
concerning physic, Rabelais, to make him recompense,
made that his jesting scurrilous work, which repaired the
printer's loss with advantage. Such books the world
swarms too much with. When one had set out a witless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
pamphlet, writing <i>finis</i> at the end thereof, another wittily
wrote beneath it:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">&mdash;&mdash;<i>Nay there thou liest, my friend,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>In writing foolish books there is no end.</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And surely such scurrilous scandalous papers do more than
conceivable mischief. First, their lusciousness puts many
palates out of taste, that they can never after relish any
solid and wholesome writers; secondly, they cast dirt on the
faces of many innocent persons, which dried on by continuance
of time can never after be washed off; thirdly, the
pamphlets of this age may pass for records with the next,
because publicly uncontrolled, and what we laugh at, our
children may believe: fourthly, grant the things true they
jeer at, yet this music is unlawful in any Christian church,
to play upon the sins and miseries of others, the fitter
object of the elegies than the satires of all truly religious.&mdash;<span class="smcap">T.
Fuller.</span> <i>The Holy State and the Profane State.</i></p>


<h3>THE EVIL THAT MEN DO</h3>

<p>If writings are thus durable, and may pass from age to
age throughout the whole course of time, how careful should
an author be of committing anything to print that may
corrupt posterity, or poison the minds of men with vice
and error! Writers of great talents, who employ their
parts in propagating immorality, and seasoning vicious
sentiments with wit and humour, are to be looked upon
as the pests of society and the enemies of mankind: they
leave books behind them, as it is said of those who die
in distempers which breed an ill will towards their own
species, to scatter infection and destroy their posterity.
They act the counterparts of a Confucius or a Socrates;
and seem to have been sent into the world to deprave
human nature, and sink it into the condition of brutality.&mdash;<span class="smcap">J.
Addison.</span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span> <i>Spectator</i>, 166.<br /><br /></p>


<p>He who has published an injurious book, sins, as it were,
in his very grave; corrupts others while he is rotting himself.&mdash;<span class="smcap">R. South.</span></p>

<h3>'TO THE PURE ALL THINGS ARE PURE'</h3>

<p>'To the pure all things are pure'; not only meats and
drinks, but all kind of knowledge, whether of good or evil;
the knowledge cannot defile, nor consequently the books,
if the will and conscience be not defiled. For books are as
meats and viands are, some of good, some of evil substance;
and yet God, in that unapocryphal vision, said without
exception, 'Rise, Peter, kill and eat'; leaving the choice to
each man's discretion. Wholesome meats to a vitiated
stomach differ little or nothing from unwholesome; and
best books to a naughty mind are not unapplicable to
occasions of evil. Bad meats will scarce breed good nourishment
in the healthiest concoction; but herein the difference
is of bad books, that they to a discreet and judicious reader
serve in many respects to discover, to confute, to forewarn,
and to illustrate.... If it be true that a wise man, like
a good refiner, can gather gold out of the drossiest volume,
and that a fool will be a fool with the best book, yea, or
without book, there is no reason that we should deprive
a wise man of any advantage to his wisdom, while we seek
to restrain from a fool that which being restrained will be
no hindrance to his folly.&mdash;<span class="smcap">J. Milton.</span> <i>Areopagitica.</i></p>


<h3>LIBERTY AND BAD BOOKS</h3>

<p>The men who died to buy us liberty knew that it was
better to let in a thousand bad books than shut out one
good one. We cannot, then, silence evil books, but we
can turn away our eyes from them; we can take care that
what we read, and what we let others read, should be good
and wholesome.&mdash;<span class="smcap">C. Kingsley.</span> <i>Village Sermons: On
Books.</i></p>


<h3>BAD BOOKS AND DEBAUCHED MINDS</h3>

<p>Books will perhaps be found, in a less degree than is
commonly imagined, the corrupters of the morals of mankind.
They form an effective subsidiary to events and the
contagion of vicious society: but, taken by themselves,
they rarely produce vice and profligacy where virtue
existed before. Everything depends upon the spirit in
which they are read. He that would extract poison from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
them, must for the most part come to them with a mind
already debauched. The power of books in generating
virtue is probably much greater than in generating vice.&mdash;<span class="smcap">W.
Godwin.</span> <i>The Inquirer: Of Choice in Reading.</i></p>

<h3>A WHIMSICAL SURPRISE</h3>

<p>I should not care to be caught in the serious avenues of
some cathedral alone, and reading <i>Candide</i>.</p>

<p>I do not remember a more whimsical surprise than having
been once detected&mdash;by a familiar damsel&mdash;reclined at my
ease upon the grass, on Primrose Hill (her Cythera), reading&mdash;<i>Pamela</i>.
There was nothing in the book to make a man
seriously ashamed at the exposure; but as she seated
herself down by me, and seemed determined to read in
company, I could have wished it had been&mdash;any other book.
We read on very sociably for a few pages; and, not finding
the author much to her taste, she got up, and&mdash;went away.
Gentle casuist, I leave it to thee to conjecture, whether
the blush (for there was one between us) was the property
of the nymph or the swain in this dilemma. From me you
shall never get the secret.&mdash;<span class="smcap">C. Lamb.</span> <i>Detached Thoughts
on Books and Reading.</i></p>


<h3>ROMANCES ARE PERNICIOUS</h3>

<p>Make careful choice of the books which you read. Let
the Holy Scriptures ever have the pre-eminence, and next
them, the solid, lively, heavenly treatises which best
expound and apply the Scriptures: and next those, the
credible histories, especially of the Church, and tractates
upon inferior sciences and arts: but take heed of the poison
of the writings of false teachers, which would corrupt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
your understandings: and of vain romances, play-books,
and false stories, which may bewitch your fantasies and
corrupt your hearts.</p>

<p>To a very judicious able reader, who is fit to censure all
he reads, there is no great danger in the reading of the
Books of any seducers: it doth but show him how little
and thin a cloak is used to cover a bad cause. But alas,
young soldiers, not used to such wars, are startled at a very
sophism, or at a terrible threatening of damnation to
dissenters (which every censorious sect can use) or at every
confident triumphant boast, or at everything that hath a
fair pretence of truth or godliness.... Meddle not therefore
with poison, till you better know how to use it, and may do it
with less danger; as long as you have no need.</p>

<p>As for play-books, and romances, and idle tales, I have
already showed, in my <i>Book of Self-denial</i>, how pernicious
they are, especially to youth, and to frothy, empty, idle
wits, that know not <i>what a man is</i>, nor what he hath to
do in the world. They are powerful baits of the Devil,
to keep more necessary things out of their minds, and
better books out of their hands, and to poison the mind so
much the more dangerously, as they are read with more
delight and pleasure.&mdash;<span class="smcap">R. Baxter.</span> <i>Christian Directory.</i></p>


<h3>WHETHER 'TIS LAWFUL TO READ ROMANCES</h3>

<p>Though we think then that the reading these Books
may be lawful, and have some Convenience too, as to
forming the Minds of Persons of Quality; yet we think
'em not all convenient for the Vulgar, because they give 'em
extravagant Ideas of Practice, and before they have Judgement
to bias their Fancies, and generally make 'em think
themselves some King or Queen or other:&mdash;One Fool must
be Mazares, t'other Artamen; and so for the Women, no
less than Queens or Empresses will serve 'em, the Inconveniences
of which are afterwards oftentimes sooner
observed than remedied. Add to this, the softening of the
Mind by Love, which are the greatest subject of these sort
of Books, and the fooling away so many Hours and Days
and Years, which might be much better employed, and
which must be repented of: And upon the whole, we think<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
Young People would do better, either not to read 'em at
all, or to use 'em more sparingly than they generally do,
when once they set about 'em.&mdash;From the <i>Athenian
Mercury</i> (1691-7).</p>


<h3>THE DANGER OF POETS AND ROMANCES</h3>

<p>It is impossible for me, by any words that I can use,
to express, to the extent of my thoughts, the danger of
suffering young people to form their opinions from the
writings of poets and romances. Nine times out of ten,
the morality they teach is bad, and must have a bad
tendency. Their wit is employed to <i>ridicule virtue</i>, as you
will almost always find, if you examine the matter to the
bottom. The world owes a very large part of its sufferings
to tyrants; but what tyrant was there amongst the ancients,
whom the poets did not place <i>amongst the gods</i>? Can you
open an English poet without, in some part or other of his
works, finding the grossest flatteries of royal and noble
persons? How are young people not to think that the
praises bestowed on these persons are just? Dryden,
Parnell, Gay, Thomson, in short, what poet have we had,
or have we, Pope only excepted, who was not, or is not,
a pensioner, or a sinecure placeman, or the wretched
dependant of some part of the Aristocracy? Of the extent
of the power of writers in producing mischief to a nation,
we have two most striking instances in the cases of Dr.
Johnson and Burke.... It is, therefore, the duty of every
father, when he puts a book into the hands of his son or
daughter, to give the reader a true account of <i>who</i> and
<i>what</i> the writer of the book was, or is.&mdash;<span class="smcap">W. Cobbett.</span> <i>Advice
to Young Men and (incidentally) to Young Women in the
Middle and Higher Ranks of Life.</i></p>


<h3>A DAUGHTER'S FAVOURITE NOVELS</h3>

<p>I could make neither head nor tail of it; it was neither
fish, flesh, nor good red herring: it was all about my Lord,
and Sir Harry, and the Captain.... The people talk such
wild gibberish as no folks in their sober senses ever did talk;
and the things that happen to them are not like the things
that ever happen to me or any of my acquaintance. They
are at home one minute, and beyond the sea the next;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
beggars to-day, and lords to-morrow; waiting-maids in
the morning, and duchesses at night.... One would think
every man in these books had the bank of England in his
escritoire.... In these books (except here and there one,
whom they make worse than Satan himself), every man
and woman's child of them, are all wise, and witty, and
generous, and rich, and handsome, and genteel, and all to
the last degree. Nobody is middling, or good in one thing
and bad in another, like my live acquaintance; but it is
all up to the skies, or down to the dirt. I had rather read
<i>Tom Hickathrift</i>, or <i>Jack the Giant Killer</i>, a thousand times.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Hannah
More.</span> <i>The Two Wealthy Farmers.</i></p>


<h3>'ONLY A NOVEL'</h3>

<p>'What are you reading, Miss&mdash;&mdash;?' 'Oh! it's only
a novel!' replies the young lady; while she lays down her
book with affected indifference, or momentary shame. 'It is
only <i>Cecilia</i>, or <i>Camilla</i>, or <i>Belinda</i>'; or, in short, only
some work in which the greatest powers of the mind are
displayed; in which the most thorough knowledge of human
nature, the happiest delineation of its varieties, the liveliest
effusions of wit or humour, are conveyed to the world in the
best chosen language.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Jane Austen.</span> <i>Northanger Abbey.</i></p>


<h3>NOVELS AS ENGINES OF CIVILIZATION</h3>

<p>The listlessness and want of sympathy with which most
of the works written expressly for circulation among the
labouring classes are read by them, if read at all, arises
mainly from this&mdash;that the story told, or the lively or
friendly style assumed, is <i>manifestly</i> and <i>palpably</i> only
a cloak for the instruction intended to be conveyed&mdash;a sort
of gilding of what they cannot well help fancying must be
a pill, when they see so much and such obvious pains taken
to wrap it up.... You will find that in the higher and
better class of works of fiction and imagination duly circulated,
you possess all that you require to strike your
grappling-iron into their souls, and chain them, willing
followers, to the car of civilization.... The novel, in its
best form, I regard as one of the most powerful engines of
civilization ever invented.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Sir J. Herschel.</span> <i>Address to
the Subscribers to the Windsor Public Library.</i></p>

physicians in England said to me only yesterday, 'I have
just read <i>So-and-So</i> for the second time' (naming one of

<h3>EVERY MAN HIS DUE</h3>

<p>As a good housewife out of divers fleeces weaves one
piece of cloth, a bee gathers wax and honey out of many
flowers, and makes a new bundle of all,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1"><i>Floriferis ut apes in saltibus omnia libant</i>,<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>I have laboriously collected this cento out of various
authors, and that <i>sine injuria</i>: I have wronged no authors,
but given every man his own; which Hierom so much
commends in Nepotian; he stole not whole verses, pages,
tracts, as some do nowadays, concealing their authors'
names; but still said this was Cyprian's, that Lactantius,
that Hilarius, so said Minutius Felix, so Victorinus, thus
far Arnobius: I cite and quote mine authors (which,
howsoever some illiterate scribblers account pedantical, as
a cloak of ignorance, and opposite to their affected fine
style, I must and will use) <i>sumpsi, non surripui</i>; and what
Varro, lib. 6 de re rust., speaks of bees, <i>minime maleficae,
nullius opus vellicantes faciunt deterius</i>, I can say of myself.
Whom have I injured? The matter is theirs most part
and yet mine: <i>apparet unde sumptum sit</i> (which Seneca
approves); <i>aliud tamen, quam unde sumptum sit, apparet</i>;
which nature doth with the aliment of our bodies, incorporate,
digest, assimilate, I do <i>concoquere quod hausi</i>,
dispose of what I take: I make them pay tribute, to set
out this my Macaronican: the method only is mine own.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
I must usurp that of <i>Wecker e Ter. nihil dictum quod non
dictum prius: methodus sola artificem ostendit</i>: we can say
nothing but what hath been said, the composition and
method is ours only, and shows a scholar. Oribasius,
Aëtius, Avicenna, have all out of Galen, but to their own
method, <i>diverso stylo, non diversa fide</i>. Our poets steal
from Homer; he spews, saith Aelian, they lick it up. Divines
use Austin's words <i>verbatim</i> still, and our story-dressers do
as much; he that comes last is commonly best,</p>

<h3>PLAGIARIE</h3>

<p>He [King Charles I, in his <i>Eikon Basilike</i>] borrows
David's Psalmes, as he charges the Assembly of Divines in
his twentieth Discourse, <i>To have set forth old Catechisms and
confessions of faith new drest</i>. Had he borrowed David's
heart, it had been much the holier theft. For such kind
of borrowing as this, if it be not bettered by the borrower,
among good Authors is accounted Plagiarie. However, this
was more tolerable than Pamela's prayer, stolen out of Sir
Philip.&mdash;<span class="smcap">J. Milton.</span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span> <i>Eikonoklastes.</i></p>


<h3>TRANSPLANTATION</h3>

<p>I number not my borrowings, but I weigh them. And if
I would have made their number to prevail, I would have
had twice as many. They are all, or almost all, of so
famous and ancient names, that methinks they sufficiently
name themselves without me. If in reasons, comparisons,
and arguments, I transplant any into my soil, or confound
them with mine own, I purposely conceal the author,
thereby to bridle the rashness of these hasty censures
that are so headlong cast upon all manner of compositions,
namely, young writings of men yet living.... I will have
them to give Plutarch a bob upon mine own lips, and vex
themselves in wronging Seneca in me.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Montaigne.</span></p>


<h3>BOOK-MAKERS AND PLAGIARISTS</h3>

<p>Some that turn over all books, and are equally searching
in all papers; that write out of what they presently find
or meet, without choice; by which means it happens that
what they have discredited and impugned in one work,
they have before or after extolled the same in another.
Such are all the Essayists, even their master Montaigne.
These in all they write confess still what books they have
read last, and therein their own folly so much that they bring
it to the stake raw and undigested; not that the place did
need it neither, but that they thought themselves furnished
and would vent it.</p>

<p>Some again, who, after they have got authority, or, which
is less, opinion, by their writings, to have read much, dare
presently to feign whole books and authors, and lie safely.
For what never was will not easily be found, not by the
most curious.</p>

<p>And some, by a cunning protestation against all reading,
and false venditation of their own naturals, think to divert
the sagacity of their readers from themselves, and cool the
scent of their fox-like thefts, when yet they are so rank as
a man may find whole pages together usurped from one
author.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ben Jonson.</span> <i>Timber.</i></p>


<h3>A LEARNED PLAGIARY</h3>

<p>The greatest man of the last age, Ben Jonson, was willing
to give place to the classics in all things: he was not only
a professed imitator of Horace, but a learned plagiary of all
the others; you track him everywhere in their snow. If
Horace, Lucan, Petronius Arbiter, Seneca, and Juvenal had
their own from him, there are few serious thoughts which
are new in him.... But he has done his robberies so openly,
that one may see he fears not to be taxed by any law. He
invades authors like a monarch; and what would be theft
in other poets, is only victory in him.&mdash;<span class="smcap">J. Dryden.</span> <i>Essay
of Dramatic Poesy.</i></p>


<p>Steal! to be sure they will, and, egad! serve your best
thoughts as gipsies do stolen children&mdash;disfigure them to
make them pass for their own.&mdash;<span class="smcap">R. B. Sheridan.</span> <i>The Critic.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>


<h3>HIDDEN TREASURE</h3>

<p>Writers ... are apter to be beholding to books than to
men, not only as the first are more in their possession, being
more constant companions than dearest friends, but because
they commonly make such use of treasure found in books
as of other treasure belonging to the dead and hidden under
ground; for they dispose of both with great secrecy,
defacing the shape or images of the one as much as of the
other, through fear of having the original of their stealth
or abundance discovered. And the next cause why writers
are more in libraries than in company is that books are
easily opened, and learned men are usually shut up by
a froward or envious humour of retention, or else unfold
themselves so as we may read more of their weakness and
vanity than wisdom, imitating the holiday-custom in great
cities, where the shops of chandlery and slight wares are
familiarly open, but those of solid and staple merchandise
are proudly locked up.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Sir W. Davenant.</span> <i>Gondibert.</i></p>


<h3>LITERARY COOKERY</h3>

<p>We have been reading a treatise on the morality of
Shakespeare; it is a happy and easy way of filling a book,
that the present race of authors have arrived at&mdash;that of
criticizing the works of some eminent poet: with monstrous
extracts and short remarks. It is a species of cookery
I begin to grow tired of; they cut up their authors into
chops, and by adding a little crumbled bread of their own,
and tossing it up a little, they present it as a fresh dish;
you are to dine upon the poet;&mdash;the critic supplies the
garnish; yet has the credit, as well as profit, of the whole
entertainment.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Hannah More.</span> <i>Memoirs.</i></p>


<h3>THE MANUFACTORY OF BOOKS</h3>

<p>To a veteran like myself, who have watched the books
of forty seasons, there is nothing so old as a new book. An
astonishing sameness and want of individuality pervades
modern books. The ideas they contain do not seem to have
passed through the mind of the writer. They have not even
that originality&mdash;the only originality which John Mill in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
his modesty would claim for himself&mdash;'which every thoughtful
mind gives to its own mode of conceiving and expressing
truths which are common property'&mdash;(<i>Autobiography</i>).
When you are in London step into the reading-room of the
British Museum. There is the great manufactory out of
which we turn the books of the season. It was so before
there was any British Museum. It was so in Chaucer's
time&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">For out of the old fields, as men saith,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Cometh all this new corn from year to year,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And out of old books in good faith<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Cometh all this new science that men lere.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It continued to be so in Cervantes' day. 'There are,'
says he in <i>Don Quixote</i>, 'men who will make you books
and turn them loose in the world with as much dispatch
as they would do a dish of fritters.'</p>

<p>It is not, then, any wonder that De Quincy should account
it 'one of the misfortunes of life that one must read thousands
of books only to discover that one need not have
read them'.... And I cannot doubt that Bishop Butler
had observed the same phenomenon when he wrote, in 1729:
'The great number of books of amusement which daily
come in one's way, have in part occasioned this idle way of
considering things. By this means time, even in solitude, is
happily got rid of without the pain of attention; neither
is any part of it more put to the account of idleness, one can
scarce forbear saying is spent with less thought, than great
part of that which is spent in reading.'&mdash;<span class="smcap">Mark Pattison.</span>

<h3>RECIPE FOR AN ANTHOLOGY</h3>

<p>Our modern wits are not to reckon upon the infinity
of matter for a constant supply. What remains, therefore,
but that our last recourse must be had to large indexes
and little compendiums? Quotations must be plentifully
gathered, and booked in alphabet; to this end, though
authors need to be little consulted, yet critics, and commentators,
and lexicons carefully must. But, above all,
those judicious collectors of bright parts, and flowers, and
<i>observandas</i>, are to be nicely dwelt on; by some called the
sieves and coulters of learning, though it is left undetermined
whether they dealt in pearls or meal, and consequently,
whether we are more to value that which passed
through, or what stayed behind. By these methods, in a few
weeks, there starts up many a writer capable of managing the
profoundest and most universal subjects. For what though
his head be empty, provided his commonplace book be full?
And if you will bate him but the circumstances of method,
and style, and grammar, and invention; allow him but the
common privileges of transcribing from others, and digressing
from himself, as often as he shall see occasion; he will
desire no more ingredients towards fitting up a treatise
that shall make a very comely figure on a bookseller's
shelf; there to be preserved neat and clean for a long
eternity, adorned with the heraldry of its title fairly
inscribed on a label; never to be thumbed or greased by
students, nor bound to everlasting chains of darkness in
a library.&mdash;<span class="smcap">J. Swift.</span> <i>A Tale of a Tub.</i><br /><br /></p>


<p>His Invention is no more than the finding out of his
papers, and his few gleanings there, and his disposition of
them is just as the book-binder's, a setting or glueing of
them together.&mdash;<span class="smcap">J. Earle.</span> <i>Microcosmographie.</i><br /><br /></p>


<p>Good God! how many dungboats full of fruitless works
do they yearly foist on his Majesty's subjects; how many
hundred reams of foolish, profane, and senseless ballads do
they quarterly disperse abroad.&mdash;<span class="smcap">G. Wither</span> (1632).</p>

<h3>THAT INVENTION OF THE ENEMY&mdash;AN ABRIDGEMENT</h3>

<p>All my life long I have delighted in voluminous works;
in other words, I have delighted in that sort of detail which
permits so intimate a familiarity with the subjects of which
it treats.... Even in this world of Beauties, and of Extracts,
I do not believe myself quite alone in my love of the elaborate
and the minute; and yet I doubt if many people
contemplate very long very big books with the sense of
coming enjoyment which such a prospect gives me; and
few shrink, as I do, with aversion and horror from that
invention of the enemy&mdash;an Abridgement. I never shall
forget the shock I experienced in seeing Bruce, that opprobrium
of an unbelieving age, that great and graphic
traveller, whose eight or nine goodly volumes took such
possession of me, that I named a whole colony of Bantams
after his Abyssinian princes and princesses, calling a little
golden strutter of a cock after that arch-tyrant the Ras
Michael; and a speckled hen, the beauty of the poultry-yard,
Ozoro Ester, in honour of the Ras's favourite wife&mdash;I
never felt greater disgust than at seeing this magnificent
work cut down to a thick, dumpy volume, seven inches by
five; except, perhaps, when I happened to light upon
another pet book&mdash;Drinkwater's <i>Siege of Gibraltar</i>, where
I had first learned to tremble at the grim realities of war,
had watched day by day the firing of the red-hot balls,
had groped my way through the galleries, and taken refuge
in the casemates,&mdash;degraded from the fair proportions of a
goodly quarto into the thin and meagre pamphlet of a lending
library, losing a portion of its lifelike truth with every
page that was cut away.&mdash;<span class="smcap">M. R. Mitford.</span> <i>Recollections
of a Literary Life.</i></p>


<h3>ORIGINAL EDITIONS</h3>

<p>We love, we own, to read the great productions of the
human mind as they were written. We have this feeling
even about scientific treatises; though we know that the
sciences are always in a state of progression, and that the
alterations made by a modern editor in an old book on
any branch of natural or political philosophy are likely to
be improvements. Some errors have been detected by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
writers of this generation in the speculations of Adam
Smith. A short cut has been made to much knowledge at
which Sir Isaac Newton arrived through arduous and
circuitous paths. Yet we still look with peculiar veneration
on the <i>Wealth of Nations</i> and on the <i>Principia</i>, and should
regret to see either of those great works garbled even by
the ablest hands. But in works which owe much of their
interest to the character and situation of the writers the
case is infinitely stronger. What man of taste and feeling
can endure <i>rifacimenti</i>, harmonies, abridgements, expurgated
editions? Who ever reads a stage-copy of a play
when he can procure the original? Who ever cut open
Mrs. Siddons's <i>Milton</i>? Who ever got through ten pages
of Mr. Gilpin's translation of John Bunyan's <i>Pilgrim</i> into
modern English? Who would lose, in the confusion of
a <i>Diatessaron</i>, the peculiar charm which belongs to the
narrative of the disciple whom Jesus loved? The feeling
of a reader who has become intimate with any great original
work is that which Adam expressed towards his bride:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">'Should God create another Eve, and I<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Another rib afford, yet loss of thee<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Would never from my heart.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>No substitute, however exquisitely formed, will fill the void
left by the original. The second beauty may be equal or
superior to the first; but still it is not she.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Lord
Macaulay.</span> <i>Boswell's Life of Johnson.</i></p>


<h3>DEDICATIONS</h3>

<p>Above all the rest, the gross and palpable flattery
whereunto many not unlearned have abased and abused
their wits and pens, turning (as Du Bartas saith) Hecuba into
Helena, and Faustina into Lucretia, hath most diminished
the price and estimation of learning. Neither is the modern
dedication of books and writings, as to patrons, to be
commended: for that books (such as are worthy the name
of books) ought to have no patrons but truth and reason.&mdash;<span class="smcap">F.

<h3>PRESENTATION COPIES</h3>

<p>I want to read you some new passages from an interleaved
copy of my book. You haven't read the printed
part yet. I gave you a copy of it, but nobody reads a book
that is given to him. Of course not. Nobody but a fool
expects him to. He reads a little in it here and there,
perhaps, and he cuts all the leaves if he cares enough about
the writer, who will be sure to call on him some day, and
if he is left alone in his library for five minutes will have
hunted every corner of it until he has found the book he
sent,&mdash;if it is to be found at all, which doesn't always
happen, if there's a penal colony anywhere in a garret or
closet for typographical offenders and vagrants.&mdash;<span class="smcap">O. W.

<h3>MEN IN THEIR NIGHTGOWNS</h3>

<p>Writing of Lives is very profitable, both to the memory
of the party, and to posterity. They do better lance into
secret humours, and present men in their nightgowns, when
they are truly themselves. A general may be more perfectly
discovered on his pallet, than when he appears in the head
of an army.&mdash;<span class="smcap">John Hall.</span> <i>Horae Vacivae.</i></p>

<h3>BIOGRAPHY</h3>

<p>Oh, that mine enemy had written a book!&mdash;and that it
were my life; unless indeed it provoked my friend to write
another.</p>

<p>It has always appeared to me a strong argument for

men whom they persist in holding up to public
contempt.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Sir A. Helps.</span> <i>Thoughts in the Cloister.</i></p>


<h3>BIOGRAPHY PREFERRED TO HISTORY</h3>

without theory.&mdash;<span class="smcap">B. Disraeli, Earl of Beaconsfield.</span>
<i>Contarini Fleming.</i></p>


<h3>ON READING TRANSLATIONS</h3>

<p>The respectable and sometimes excellent translations of
Bohn's Library have done for literature what railroads have
done for internal intercourse. I do not hesitate to read
all the books I have named, and all good books, in translations.
What is really best in any book is translatable,&mdash;any
real insight or broad human sentiment. Nay, I
observe that, in our Bible, and other books of lofty moral
tone, it seems easy and inevitable to render the rhythm
and music of the original into phrases of equal melody.
The Italians have a fling at translators,&mdash;<i>i traditori
traduttori</i>; but I thank them. I rarely read any Latin,
Greek, German, Italian, sometimes not a French book in
the original, which I can procure in a good version. I like
to be beholden to the great metropolitan English speech,
the sea which receives tributaries from every region under
heaven. I should as soon think of swimming across the
Charles River when I wish to go to Boston, as of reading
all my books in originals, when I have them rendered for
me in my mother-tongue.&mdash;<span class="smcap">R. W. Emerson.</span> <i>Books.</i></p>

<h3>WHEN TRANSLATIONS ARE TO BE PREFERRED</h3>

<p>The reason the classics are not read is because there still
lingers a tradition, handed down from the eighteenth
century, that it is useless to read them unless in the original.
A tone of sarcastic contempt is maintained towards the
person who shall presume to peruse Xenophon not in the
original Greek, or Virgil not in the original Latin.</p>

<p>In the view of these critics it is the Greek, it is the Latin,
that is valuable, not the contents of the volume. Shakespeare,
however, the greatest genius of England, thought
otherwise. It is known that his ideas of Grecian and Roman
history were derived from somewhat rude translations, yet
it is acknowledged that the spirit of the ancient warriors
and of the ancient luxury lives in his <i>Antony and Cleopatra</i>,
and nowhere in all the ancient writers is there a poem
breathing the idea of Aphrodite like his <i>Venus and Adonis</i>.
The example of so great a genius may shield us in an effort
to free the modern mind from this eighteenth-century
incubus.</p>

<p>The truth is, the classics are much better understood in
a good translation than in the original. To obtain a suffi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>cient
knowledge of Greek, for instance, to accurately translate
is almost the work of a lifetime. Concentration upon
this one pursuit gradually contracts the general perceptions,
and it has often happened that an excellent scholar has
been deficient in common knowledge, as shown by the
singular character of his own notes. But his work of translation
in itself is another matter.</p>

<p>It is a treasure; from it poets derive their illustrations;
dramatists their plots; painters their pictures. A young
mind full of intelligence, coming to such a translation,
enters at once into the spirit of the ancient writer. A good
translation is thus better than the original.&mdash;<span class="smcap">R. Jefferies.</span>
<i>The Dewy Morn.</i></p>


<h3>'THAT SILLY VANITY OF IMPERTINENT CITATIONS'</h3>

<p>'Twas this vain idolizing of authors which gave birth
to that silly vanity of impertinent citations, and inducing
authority in things neither requiring nor deserving it. That
saying was much more observable, <i>That men have beards
and women none</i>, because quoted from Beza; and that
other, <i>Pax res bona est</i>, because brought in with a 'said
St. Austin'. But these ridiculous fooleries, to your more
generous discerners, signify nothing but the pedantry of the
affected sciolist. 'Tis an inglorious acquist to have our
heads or volumes laden as were Cardinal Campeius his mules,
with old and useless baggage.&mdash;<span class="smcap">J. Glanvill.</span> <i>The Vanity
of Dogmatizing.</i></p>


<h3>QUOTATION</h3>

<p>In quoting of books, quote such authors as are usually
read; others you may read for your own satisfaction, but
not name them.</p>

<p>Quoting of authors is most for matter of fact; and then
I write them as I would produce a witness; sometimes
for a free expression, and then I give the author his due,
and gain myself praise by reading him.</p>

<p>To quote a modern Dutchman where I may use a classic
author, is as if I were to justify my reputation, and I neglect
all persons of note and quality that know me, and bring the
testimonial of the scullion in the kitchen.&mdash;<span class="smcap">J. Selden</span>.
<i>Table Talk.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>


<h3>MERIT IN QUOTATION</h3>

<p>Next to the originator of a good sentence is the first
quoter of it.... We are as much informed of a writer's
genius by what he selects as by what he originates. We
read the quotation with his eyes, and find a new and fervent
sense; as a passage from one of the poets, well recited,
borrows new interest from the rendering. As the journals
say, 'the italics are ours.' The profit of books is according
to the sensibility of the reader. The profoundest thought
or passion sleeps as in a mine, until an equal mind and
heart finds and publishes it. The passages of Shakespeare
that we most prize were never quoted until within this
century; and Milton's prose, and Burke, even, have their
best fame within it. Every one, too, remembers his friends
by their favourite poetry or other reading.</p>

<p>Observe, also, that a writer appears to more advantage
in the pages of another book than in his own. In his
own, he waits as a candidate for your approbation; in
another's he is a lawgiver.&mdash;<span class="smcap">R. W. Emerson.</span> <i>Quotation
and Originality.</i></p>

<h3>THE SEAT OF AUTHORITY</h3>

<p>You despise books; you, whose lives are absorbed in the
vanities of ambition, the pursuit of pleasure, or in indolence;
but remember that all the known world, excepting only
savage nations, is governed by books. All Africa, to the
limits of Ethiopia and Nigritia, obeys the book of the
Koran, after bowing to the book of the Gospel. China is
ruled by the moral book of Confucius, and a great part of
India by the Vedah. Persia was governed for ages by the
books of one of the Zoroasters.</p>

<p>In a law-suit or criminal process, your property, your
honour, perhaps your life, depends on the interpretation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
of a book which you never read.... You are acquainted
with neither Hippocrates nor Boerhaave nor Sydenham;
but you place your body in the hands of those who can
read them.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Voltaire.</span> <i>Philosophical Dictionary</i>: Books.</p>


<h3>BOOKS PREFERRED TO PREACHERS</h3>

<p>The writings of divines are nothing else but a preaching
the Gospel to the eye, as the voice preacheth it to the ear.
Vocal preaching hath the pre-eminence in moving the
affections, and becometh diversified according to the state
of the congregations which attend it: this way the milk
cometh warmest from the breast. But books have the
advantage in many other respects: you may read an able
preacher when you have but a mean one to hear. Every
congregation cannot hear the most judicious or powerful
preachers: but every single person may read the books of
the most powerful and judicious; preachers may be silenced
or banished, when books may be at hand: books may be
kept at a smaller charge than preachers: we may choose
books which treat of that very subject which we desire to
hear of; but we cannot choose what subject the preacher
shall treat of. Books we may have at hand every day and
hour: when we can have sermons but seldom, and at set
times. If sermons be forgotten, they are gone. But a book
we may read over and over till we remember it; and if we
forget it, may again peruse it at our pleasure, or at our
leisure. So that good books are a very great mercy to the
world.&mdash;<span class="smcap">R. Baxter.</span> <i>Christian Directory.</i></p>


<h3>BOOKS OF MORALITY</h3>

<p>Books of morality are daily written, yet its influence is
still little in the world; so the ground is annually ploughed,
and yet multitudes are in want of bread. But, surely,
neither the labours of the moralist nor of the husbandman
are vain: let them for a while neglect their tasks and their
usefulness will be known; the wickedness that is now frequent
would become universal, the bread that is now scarce
would wholly fail.&mdash;<span class="smcap">S. Johnson.</span> <i>Adventurer</i>, 137.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>


<h3>THE SECRET INFLUENCE OF BOOKS</h3>

<p>Books have always a secret influence on the understanding:
we cannot at pleasure obliterate ideas; he that reads
books of science, though without any fixed desire of improvement,
will grow more knowing; he that entertains himself
with moral or religious treatises will imperceptibly advance
in goodness; the ideas which are often offered to the mind
will at last find a lucky moment when it is disposed to
receive them.&mdash;<span class="smcap">S. Johnson.</span> <i>Adventurer</i>, 137.</p>


<h3>DEAD COUNSELLORS ARE SAFEST</h3>

<p>It was the maxim, I think, of Alphonsus of Aragon that
<i>dead counsellors are safest</i>. The grave puts an end to flattery
and artifice, and the information that we receive from
books is pure from interest, fear, or ambition. Dead
counsellors are likewise most instructive, because they are
heard with patience and with reverence. We are not
unwilling to believe that man wiser than ourselves from
whose abilities we may receive advantage without any
danger of rivalry or opposition, and who affords us the
light of his experience without hurting our eyes by flashes
of insolence.&mdash;<span class="smcap">S. Johnson.</span> <i>Rambler</i>, 87.</p>


<h3>THE REAL WORKING EFFECTIVE CHURCH</h3>

<p>But to the Church itself, as I hinted already, all is
changed, in its preaching, in its working, by the introduction
of Books. The Church is the working recognized Union
of our Priests or Prophets, of those who by wise teaching
guide the souls of men. While there was no Writing, even
while there was no Easy-writing, or <i>Printing</i>, the preaching
of the voice was the natural sole method of performing this.
But now with Books!&mdash;He that can write a true Book, to
persuade England, is not he the Bishop and Archbishop,
the Primate of England and of all England? I many a time
say, the writers of Newspapers, Pamphlets, Poems, Books,
these <i>are</i> the real working effective Church of a modern
country. Nay, not only our preaching, but even our worship,
is not it too accomplished by means of Printed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
Books?... Fragments of a real 'Church Liturgy' and
'Body of Homilies', strangely disguised from the common
eye, are to be found weltering in that huge froth-ocean of
Printed Speech we loosely call Literature! Books are our
Church too.</p>

<p>On all sides, are we not driven to the conclusion that, of
the things which man can do or make here below, by far
the most momentous, wonderful and worthy are the things
we call Books! Those poor bits of rag-paper with black
ink on them;&mdash;from the Daily Newspaper to the sacred
Hebrew <span class="smcap">Book</span>, what have they not done, what are they not
doing!&mdash;For indeed, whatever be the outward form of the
things (bits of paper, as we say, and black ink), is it not
verily, at bottom, the highest act of man's faculty that
produces a Book? It is the <i>Thought</i> of man; the true
thaumaturgic virtue; by which man works all things
whatsoever. All that he does, and brings to pass, is the
vesture of a Thought. This London City, with all its
houses, palaces, steam-engines, cathedrals, and huge immeasurable
traffic and tumult, what is it but a Thought, but
millions of Thoughts made into One;&mdash;a huge immeasurable
Spirit of a <span class="smcap">Thought</span>, embodied in brick, iron, smoke, dust,
Palaces, Parliaments, Hackney Coaches, Katherine Docks,
and the rest of it! Not a brick was made but some man had
to <i>think</i> of the making of that brick.&mdash;The thing we called
'bits of paper with traces of black ink', is the <i>purest</i>
embodiment a Thought of man can have. No wonder it is,
in all ways, the activest and noblest.&mdash;<span class="smcap">T. Carlyle.</span> <i>Heroes
and Hero-Worship.</i></p>


<h3>BOOKS AS SIGN-POSTS</h3>

<p>The modern scholars have their usual recourse to the
Universities of their countries; some few, it may be, to
those of their neighbours; and this in quest of books
rather than men for their guides, though these are living
and those in comparison but dead instructors, which, like
a hand with an inscription, can point out the straight way
upon the road, but can neither tell you the next turnings,
resolve your doubts, or answer your questions, like a guide
that has traced it over, and perhaps knows it as well as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
his chamber. And who are these dead guides we seek in
our journey? They are at best but some few authors that
remain among us of a great many that wrote in Greek and
Latin from the age of Hippocrates to that of Marcus
Antoninus, which reaches not much above six hundred
years.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Sir W. Temple.</span> <i>Ancient and Modern Learning.</i></p>


<h3>THE NEED OF A GUIDE TO BOOKS</h3>

<p>The colleges, whilst they provide us with libraries,
furnish no professor of books; and, I think, no chair is so
much wanted. In a library we are surrounded by many
hundreds of dear friends, but they are imprisoned by an
enchanter in these paper and leathern boxes; and, though
they know us, and have been waiting two, ten, or twenty
centuries for us,&mdash;some of them,&mdash;and are eager to give us
a sign, and unbosom themselves, it is the law of their
limbo that they must not speak until spoken to; and as
the enchanter has dressed them, like battalions of infantry,
in coat and jacket of one cut, by the thousand and ten
thousand, your chance of hitting on the right one is to be
computed by the arithmetical rule of Permutation and
Combination,&mdash;not a choice out of three caskets, but out
of half a million caskets all alike. But it happens in our
experience, that in this lottery there are at least fifty or
a hundred blanks to a prize. It seems, then, as if some
charitable soul, after losing a great deal of time among the
false books, and alighting upon a few true ones which made
him happy and wise, would do a right act in naming those
which have been bridges or ships to carry him safely over
dark morasses and barren oceans, into the heart of sacred
cities, into palaces and temples. This would be best done
by those great masters of books who from time to time
appear,&mdash;the Fabricii, the Seldens, Magliabecchis, Scaligers,
Mirandolas, Bayles, Johnsons, whose eyes sweep the whole
horizon of learning. But private readers, reading purely
for love of the book, would serve us by leaving each the
shortest note of what he found.&mdash;<span class="smcap">R. W. Emerson.</span>
<i>Books.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>


<h3>THE TRUE UNIVERSITY OF THESE DAYS</h3>

<p>To look at Teaching, for instance. Universities are a
notable, respectable product of the modern ages. Their
existence too is modified, to the very basis of it, by the
existence of Books. Universities arose while there were
yet no Books procurable; while a man, for a single Book,
had to give an estate of land. That, in those circumstances,
when a man had some knowledge to communicate, he
should do it by gathering the learners round him, face to
face, was a necessity for him. If you wanted to know what
Abelard knew, you must go and listen to Abelard. Thousands,
as many as thirty thousand, went to hear Abelard
and that metaphysical theology of his. And now for any
other teacher who had also something of his own to teach,
there was a great convenience opened: so many thousands
eager to learn were already assembled yonder; of all places
the best place for him was that. For any third teacher it
was better still; and grew ever the better, the more
teachers there came. It only needed now that the King
took notice of this new phenomenon; combined or agglomerated
the various schools into one school; gave it
edifices, privileges, encouragements, and named it <i>Universitas</i>,
or School of all Sciences: the University of Paris,
in its essential characters, was there. The model of all
subsequent Universities; which down even to these days,
for six centuries now, have gone on to found themselves.
Such, I conceive, was the origin of Universities. It is clear,
however, that with this simple circumstance, facility of
getting Books, the whole conditions of the business from
top to bottom were changed. Once invent Printing, you
metamorphosed all Universities, or superseded them! The
Teacher needed not now to gather men personally round him,
that he might <i>speak</i> to them what he knew: print it in
a Book, and all learners far and wide, for a trifle, had it
each at his own fireside, much more effectually to learn it!&mdash;Doubtless
there is still peculiar virtue in Speech; even
writers of Books may still, in some circumstances, find it
convenient to speak also,&mdash;witness our present meeting
here! There is, one would say, and must ever remain
while man has a tongue, a distinct province for Speech as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
well as for Writing and Printing. In regard to all things
this must remain; to Universities among others. But the
limits of the two have nowhere yet been pointed out,
ascertained; much less put in practice: the University
which would completely take-in that great new fact, of the
existence of Printed Books, and stand on a clear footing
for the Nineteenth Century as the Paris one did for the
Thirteenth, has not yet come into existence. If we think
of it, all that a University, or final highest School, can do
for us, is still but what the first School began doing&mdash;teach
us to <i>read</i>. We learn to <i>read</i>, in various languages, in
various sciences; we learn the alphabet and letters of all
manner of Books. But the place where we are to get knowledge,
even theoretic knowledge, is the Books themselves!
It depends on what we read, after all manner of Professors
have done their best for us. The true University of these
days is a Collection of Books.&mdash;<span class="smcap">T. Carlyle.</span> <i>Heroes and
Hero-Worship.</i></p>

<h3>A CRITIC</h3>

<p>is one that has spelt over a great many of books, and his
observation is the orthography. He is the surgeon of old
authors, and heals the wounds of dust and ignorance. He
converses much in fragments and <i>Desunt multa</i>'s, and if he
piece it up with two lines, he is more proud of that book
than the author. He runs over all sciences to peruse their
syntaxes, and thinks all learning comprised in writing
Latin. He tastes styles, as some discreeter palaters do
wine; and tells you which is genuine, which sophisticate
and bastard. His own phrase is a miscellany of old words,
deceased long before the Caesars, and entombed by Varro,
and the modernest man he follows is Plautus. He writes
<i>Omneis</i> at length, and <i>quicquid</i>, and his gerund is most
inconformable. He is a troublesome vexer of the dead,
which after so long sparing must rise up to the judgement
of his castigations. He is one that makes all books sell

<h3>LITERARY HYPOCRISY</h3>

<p>There are some subjects of which almost all the world
perceive the futility; yet all combine in imposing upon
each other as worthy of praise. But chiefly this imposition
obtains in literature, where men publicly contemn what
they relish with rapture in private, and approve abroad

<h3>IN THE SEAT OF THE SCORNER</h3>

<p>They who are in the habit of passing sentence upon
books,&mdash;and what ignoramus in our days does not deem
himself fully qualified for sitting in the seat of the scorner?&mdash;are
apt to think that they have condemned a work irretrievably,
when they have pronounced it to be unintelligible.
Unintelligible to whom? To themselves, the self-constituted
judges. So that their sentence presumes their
competency to pronounce it: and this, to every one save
themselves, may be exceedingly questionable.</p>

<p>It is true, the very purpose for which a writer publishes
his thoughts, is, that his readers should share them with
him. Hence the primary requisite of a style is its intelligible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>ness:
that is to say, it must be capable of being understood.
But intelligibleness is a relative quality, varying with the
capacity of the reader. The easiest book in a language is
inaccessible to those who have never set foot within the
pale of that language. The simplest elementary treatise
in any science is obscure and perplexing, until we become
familiar with the terminology of that science. Thus every
writer is entitled to demand a certain amount of knowledge
in those for whom he writes, and a certain degree of dexterity
in using the implements of thought....</p>

<p>When a man says he sees nothing in a book, he very often
means that he does not see himself in it: which, if it is not
a comedy or a satire, is likely enough.&mdash;<span class="smcap">A. W.</span> and <span class="smcap">J. C.
Hare</span>. <i>Guesses at Truth.</i></p>


<h3>THE FINAL VERDICT UPON BOOKS</h3>

<p>They who make up the final verdict upon every book are
not the partial and noisy readers of the hour when it
appears; but a court as of angels, a public not to be bribed,
not to be entreated, and not to be overawed, decides upon
every man's title to fame. Only those books come down
which deserve to last. Gilt edges, vellum, and morocco,
and presentation copies to all the libraries, will not preserve
a book in circulation beyond its intrinsic date. It must go
with all Walpole's Noble and Royal Authors to its fate.
Blackmore, Kotzebue, or Pollock may endure for a night,
but Moses and Homer stand for ever. There are not in the
world at any one time more than a dozen persons who read
and understand Plato: never enough to pay for an edition
of his works; yet to every generation these come duly
down, for the sake of those few persons, as if God brought
them in his hand. 'No book,' said Bentley, 'was ever
written down by any but itself.' The permanence of all
books is fixed by no effort friendly or hostile, but by their
own specific gravity, or the intrinsic importance of their
contents to the constant mind of man.&mdash;<span class="smcap">R. W. Emerson.</span>
<i>Spiritual Laws.</i><br /><br /></p>


<p>Talent alone cannot make a writer. There must be
a man behind the book.&mdash;<span class="smcap">R. W. Emerson.</span> <i>Goethe.</i></p>

<h3>THE CRITICS' INFLUENCE ON THE PUBLIC</h3>

<p>The opinion of the great body of the reading public is
very materially influenced even by the unsupported assertions
of those who assume a right to criticize. Nor is the
public altogether to blame on this account. Most even of
those who have really a great enjoyment in reading are in the
same state, with respect to a book, in which a man who has
never given particular attention to the art of painting is
with respect to a picture. Every man who has the least
sensibility or imagination derives a certain pleasure from
pictures. Yet a man of the highest and finest intellect might,
unless he had formed his taste by contemplating the best
pictures, be easily persuaded by a knot of connoisseurs that
the worst daub in Somerset House was a miracle of art.</p>

<p>Just such is the manner in which nine readers out of ten
judge of a book. They are ashamed to dislike what men
who speak as having authority declare to be good.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Lord
Macaulay.</span> <i>Mr. Robert Montgomery's Poems.</i></p>


<h3>TASTE IN LITERATURE AND ART</h3>

<p>I know many persons who have the purest taste in
literature, and yet false taste in art, and it is a phenomenon
which puzzles me not a little; but I have never known any
one with false taste in books, and true taste in pictures. It
is also of the greatest importance to you, not only for art's
sake, but for all kinds of sake, in these days of book deluge,
to keep out of the salt swamps of literature, and live on
a little rocky island of your own, with a spring and a lake
in it, pure and good. I cannot, of course, suggest the choice
of your library to you: every several mind needs different
books; but there are some books which we all need, and
assuredly, if you read Homer, Plato, Aeschylus, Herodotus,
Dante, Shakespeare, and Spenser, as much as you ought,
you will not require wide enlargement of shelves to right
and left of them for purposes of perpetual study.&mdash;<span class="smcap">J. Ruskin.</span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
<i>The Elements of Drawing.</i></p>


<p>'There is no book so bad,' said the bachelor, 'but something
good may be found in it.'&mdash;<span class="smcap">Cervantes.</span></p>


<h3>THE FILIAL PIETY OF BOOKS</h3>

<p>Nor is there any paternal fondness which seems to savour
less of absolute instinct, and which may be so well reconciled
to worldly wisdom, as this of authors for their books.
These children may most truly be called the riches of their
father, and many of them have with true filial piety fed
their parent in his old age; so that not only the affection
but the interest of the author may be highly injured by
those slanderers whose poisonous breath brings his book to
an untimely end.</p>

<p>Lastly, the slanderer of a book is, in truth, the slanderer
of the author ... neither can any one give the names of
sad stuff, horrid nonsense, &amp;c., to a book, without calling
the author a blockhead; which, though in a moral sense it
is a preferable appellation to that of villain, is, perhaps,
rather more injurious to his worldly interest.&mdash;<span class="smcap">H. Fielding.</span>
<i>Tom Jones.</i></p>


<h3>THE MOTE AND THE BEAM</h3>

<p>To complain in print of the multitude of books seems to
me a self-accusing vanity, whilst the querulous reprehenders
add to the cause of complaint and transgress themselves
in that which they seem to wish amended. 'Tis true, the
births of the press are numerous, nor is there less variety
in the humours and fancies of perusers, and while the number
of the one exceeds not the diversity of the other some will
not think that too much which others judge superfluous.
The genius of one approves what another disregardeth.
And were nothing to pass the press but what were suited
to the universal gusto, farewell, typography!... I seek
no applause from the disgrace of others, nor will I, huckster-like,
discredit any man's ware to recommend mine own.
I am not angry that there are so many books already
(bating only the anomalies of impiety and irreligion), nor
will I plead the necessity of publishing mine from feigned
importunities.&mdash;<span class="smcap">J. Glanvill.</span> <i>The Vanity of Dogmatizing.</i><br /><br /></p>


<p>The foolishest book is a kind of leaky boat on the sea of
wisdom; some of the wisdom will get in, anyhow.&mdash;<span class="smcap">O. W. Holmes.</span>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>


<h3>CENSORSHIP</h3>

<p>Popish books teach and inform; what we know, we know
much out of them. The fathers, church story, school-men,
all may pass for popish books; and if you take away them,
what learning will you leave? Besides, who must be judge?
The customer or the waiter? If he disallows a book it must
not be brought into the kingdom; then Lord have mercy
upon all scholars! These puritan preachers, if they have
anything good, they have it out of popish books, though
they will not acknowledge it, for fear of displeasing the
people. He is a poor divine that cannot sever the good
from the bad.&mdash;<span class="smcap">J. Selden</span>. <i>Table Talk</i>.</p>


<h3>THE IMPRIMATUR</h3>

<p>Learning hath of late years met with an obstruction in
many places which suppresses it from flourishing or increasing,
in spite of all its other helps, and that is the inquisition
upon the press, which prohibits any book from coming
forth without an imprimatur; an old relic of popery, only
necessary for the concealing of such defects of government
which of right ought to be discovered and amended.&mdash;<span class="smcap">C.
Blount</span>. <i>A Just Vindication of Learning</i>, 1693.</p>


<h3>A GREAT BOOK IS A GREAT EVIL</h3>

<p>[Greek: Méga biblíon méga kakón]</p>

<p>A man who publishes his works in a volume has an infinite
advantage over one who communicates his writings to the
world in loose tracts and single pieces. We do not expect
to meet with anything in a bulky volume till after some
heavy preamble, and several words of course, to prepare
the reader for what follows: nay, authors have established
it as a kind of rule, that a man ought to be dull sometimes,
as the most severe reader makes allowances for many rests
and nodding-places in a voluminous writer. This gave
occasion to the famous Greek proverb which I have chosen
for my motto, <i>That a great book is a great evil</i>....</p>

<p>An essay writer must practise in the chemical method
and give the virtue of a full draught in a few drops. Were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
all books reduced thus to their quintessence, many a bulky
author would make his appearance in a penny-paper: there
would be scarce such a thing in nature as a folio: the works
of an age would be contained on a few shelves, not to
mention millions of volumes that would be utterly annihilated....</p>

<p>When knowledge, instead of being bound up in books, and
kept in libraries and retirements, is thus obtruded upon the
public; when it is canvassed in every assembly, and exposed
upon every table; I cannot forbear reflecting upon that
passage in the Proverbs, 'Wisdom crieth without, she
uttereth her voice in the streets.'&mdash;<span class="smcap">J. Addison.</span> <i>Spectator</i>, 124.</p>


<h3>A LITTLE BOOK THE MOST EXCELLENT</h3>

<p>For books we shall generally find that the most excellent
in any art or science have been still the smallest and most
compendious; and this not without ground, for it is an
argument that the author was a master of what he wrote,
and had a clear notion and a full comprehension of the
subject before him. For the reason of things lies in a little
compass, if the mind could at any time be so happy as to
light upon it. Most of the writings and discourses in the
world are but illustration and rhetoric, which signifies as
much as nothing to a mind eager in pursuit after the causes
and philosophical truth of things.... The truth is, there
could be no such thing as art or science, could not the mind
of man gather the general natures of things out of the heap
of numberless particulars, and then bind them up into such
short aphorisms or propositions, that so they may be made
portable to the memory, and thereby become ready and at
hand for the judgement to apply and make use of as there
shall be occasion.&mdash;<span class="smcap">R. South.</span> <i>Sermon against long extempore
prayers.</i><br /><br /></p>


<p>There are many books written by many men, from which
two truths only are discoverable by the readers; namely,
that the writers thereof wanted two things,&mdash;principle and
preferment.&mdash;<span class="smcap">C. C. Colton.</span> <i>Lacon.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>


<h3>BOOKS WITH ONE IDEA IN THEM</h3>

<p>An amusing catalogue might be made of books which
contain but one good passage. They would be a sort of
single-speech Hamiltons; if Balaam's palfrey might not
be thought a more apt counterpart to them. Killigrew's
play of the Parson's Wedding, which in length of massy
dullness exceeds many books, is remarkable for one little
spark of liveliness. The languishing fine lady of the piece
exclaims most characteristically, upon coming in tired with
walking: 'I am glad I am come home, for I'm e'en as weary
with this walking. For God's sake, whereabouts does the
pleasure of walking lie? I swear I have often sought it
till I was weary, and yet I could ne'er find it.'&mdash;Charron on
Wisdom, a cumbrous piece of formality, which Pope's
eulogium lately betrayed me into the perusal of, has one
splendid passage, page 138, (I think) English translation.
It contrasts the open honours with which we invest the
sword, as the means of putting man out of the world, with
the concealing and retiring circumstances that accompany
his introduction into it. It is a piece of gorgeous and happy
eloquence.&mdash;What could Pope mean by that line,&mdash;'sage
Montaigne, or more sage Charron?' Montaigne is an
immense treasure-house of observation, anticipating all the
discoveries of succeeding essayists. You cannot dip in him
without being struck with the aphorism, that there is
nothing new under the sun. All the writers on common life
since him have done nothing but echo him. You cannot
open him without detecting a <i>Spectator</i> or starting a <i>Rambler</i>;
besides that his own character pervades the whole,
and binds it sweetly together. Charron is a mere piece of
formality, scholastic dry bones, without sinew or living
flesh.&mdash;<span class="smcap">C. Lamb</span>. <i>Table Talk.</i></p>


<h3>BOOKS OF ONE THOUGHT</h3>

<p>Few books have more than one thought: the generality
indeed have not quite so many. The more ingenious authors
of the former seem to think that, if they once get their
candle lighted, it will burn on for ever. Yet even a candle
gives a sorry, melancholy light unless it has a brother beside
it, to shine on it and keep it cheerful. For lights and thoughts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
are social and sportive: they delight in playing with and
into each other. One can hardly conceive a duller state
of existence than sitting at whist with three dummies: and
yet many of our prime philosophers have seldom done anything
else.&mdash;A. W. and <span class="smcap">J. C. Hare</span>. <i>Guesses at Truth.</i></p>


<h3>INDUCTIVE CRITICISM</h3>

<p>A heedy reader shall often discover in other men's compositions
perfections far differing from the author's meaning,
and such as haply he never dreamed of, and illustrateth
them with richer senses and more excellent constructions.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Montaigne.</span></p>


<h3>READING BETWEEN LINES</h3>

<p>In hours of high mental activity we sometimes do the
book too much honour, reading out of it better things than
the author wrote,&mdash;reading, as we say, between the lines.
You have had the like experience in conversation: the wit
was in what you heard, not in what the speakers said. Our
best thought came from others. We heard in their words
a deeper sense than the speakers put into them, and could
express ourselves in other people's phrases to finer purpose
than they knew.&mdash;<span class="smcap">R. W. Emerson.</span> <i>Quotation and
Originality.</i></p>


<h3>PURPLE PATCHES</h3>

<p>There are some fine passages, I am told, in that book.</p>

<p>Are there? Then beware of them. Fine passages are
mostly <i>culs de sac</i>. For in books also does one see</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">Rich windows that exclude the light<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And passages that lead to nothing.<br /><br /></span>

</div></div>


<p>There's more ado to interpret interpretations than to
interpret things, and more books upon books than upon
any other subject. We do but inter-glose ourselves. All
swarmeth with commentaries; of authors there is great
penury.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Montaigne.</span></p>


<h3>THE ROYAL ROAD</h3>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p>ERASMUS. I am told there is a certain compendious art,
that will help a man to accomplish himself with all the
liberal sciences by a very little labour.</p>

<p>DESIDERIUS. What is that you talk of? Did you ever
see the book?</p>

<p>ERASMUS. I did see it, and that was all, having nobody
to instruct me in the use of it.</p>

<p>DESIDERIUS. What was the subject of the book?</p>

<p>ERASMUS. It treated of various forms of dragons, lions,
leopards; and various circles, and words written in them,
some in Greek, some in Latin, and some in Hebrew and
other barbarous languages.</p>

<p>DESIDERIUS. Pray, in how many days' time did the title-page
promise you the knowledge of the arts and sciences?</p>

<p>ERASMUS. In fourteen.</p>

<p>DESIDERIUS. In truth, a very noble promise. But did
you ever know anybody that has become learned by that
notable art?</p>

<p>ERASMUS. No.</p>

<p>DESIDERIUS. No, nor nobody ever did, or ever will, till
we can see an alchemist grow rich.</p>

<p>ERASMUS. Why, is there no such art then? I wish with
all my heart there was.</p>

<p>DESIDERIUS. Perhaps you do, because you would not
be at the pains which are required to become learned.</p>

<p>ERASMUS. You are right.</p>

<p>DESIDERIUS. It seemed meet to the Divine Being that
the common riches, gold, jewels, silver, palaces, and kingdoms
should be bestowed on the slothful and undeserving;
but the true riches, and such as are properly our own, must
be gotten by labour.</p>

<h3>READERS AND WRITERS</h3>

<p>Many books require no thought from those who read
them, and for a very simple reason;&mdash;they made no such
demand on those who wrote them. Those works therefore
are the most valuable, that set our thinking faculties in the
fullest operation.&mdash;<span class="smcap">C. C. Colton.</span> <i>Lacon.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>


<h3>STUDIES</h3>

<p>Studies serve for delight, for ornament, and for ability.
Their chief use for delight, is in privateness and retiring;
for ornament, is in discourse; and for ability, is in the
judgement and disposition of business; for expert men can
execute, and perhaps judge of particulars, one by one; but
the general counsels, and the plots and marshalling of
affairs come best from those that are learned. To spend
too much time in studies, is sloth; to use them too much
for ornament, is affectation; to make judgement wholly by
their rules, is the humour of a scholar: they perfect nature,
and are perfected by experience: for natural abilities are
like natural plants, that need pruning by study; and
studies themselves do give forth directions too much at
large, except they be bounded in by experience. Crafty
men contemn studies, simple men admire them, and wise
men use them; for they teach not their own use; but that
is a wisdom without them and above them, won by observation.
Read not to contradict and confute, nor to believe
and take for granted, nor to find talk and discourse, but
to weigh and consider. Some books are to be tasted, others
to be swallowed, and some few to be chewed and digested:
that is, some books are to be read only in parts; others to
be read, but not curiously; and some few to be read wholly,
and with diligence and attention. Some books also may be
read by deputy, and extracts made of them by others; but
that would be only in the less important arguments, and
the meaner sort of books; else distilled books are, like
common distilled waters, flashy things. Reading maketh
a full man; conference a ready man; and writing an exact
man; and, therefore, if a man write little, he had need have
a great memory; if he confer little, he had need have a
present wit; and if he read little, he had need have much
cunning, to seem to know that he doth not. Histories
make men wise; poets, witty; the mathematics, subtile;
natural philosophy, deep; moral, grave; logic and rhetoric,
able to contend: <i>Abeunt studia in mores</i>; nay, there is
no stand or impediment in the wit, but may be wrought out
by fit studies: like as diseases of the body may have
appropriate exercises; bowling is good for the stone and
reins, shooting for the lungs and breast, gentle walking for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
the stomach, riding for the head and the like; so if a man's
wit be wandering, let him study the mathematics; for in
demonstrations, if his wit be called away never so little,
he must begin again; if his wit be not apt to distinguish or
find difference, let him study the schoolmen, for they are
<i>Cymini sectores</i>. If he be not apt to beat over matters,
and to call up one thing to prove and illustrate another, let
him study the lawyers' cases: so every defect of the mind
may have a special receipt.&mdash;<span class="smcap">F. Bacon, Lord Verulam.</span>
<i>Essays.</i></p>


<h3>HOW TO SPEND OUR DAYS</h3>

<p>After some while meditation, I walk up to my masters
and companions, my books: and, sitting down amongst
them, with the best contentment, I dare not reach forth my
hand to salute any of them till I have first looked up to
heaven, and craved favour of Him to whom all my studies
are duly referred, without whom I can neither profit nor
labour. After this, out of no over-great variety, I call forth
those which may best fit my occasions; wherein I am not
too scrupulous of age: sometimes I put myself to school,
to one of those ancients, whom the Church hath honoured
with the name of Fathers, whose volumes I confess not to
open without a secret reverence of their holiness and
gravity: sometimes to those latter doctors, which want
nothing but age to make them classical: always to God's
Book. That day is lost whereof some hours are not improved
in those divine monuments: others I turn over out
of choice; these out of duty.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Joseph Hall.</span> (Letter to
Lord Denny.)</p>


<h3>THE CHOICE OF BOOKS</h3>

<p>In study there must be an expulsive virtue to shun all
that is erroneous; and there is no science but is full of
such stuff, which by direction of tutor and choice of good
books must be excerned. Do not confound yourself with
multiplicity of authors; two is enough upon any science,
provided they be plenary and orthodox; <i>Philosophy</i> should
be your substantial food, <i>Poetry</i> your banqueting stuff;
<i>Philosophy</i> hath more of reality in it than any Knowledge,
the <i>Philosopher</i> can fathom the deep, measure mountains,
reach the stars with a staff, and bless heaven with a girdle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>But among these Studies you must not forget the <i>unicum
necessarium</i>; on Sundays and Holidays let <i>Divinity</i> be the
sole object of your speculation, in comparison whereof all
other knowledge is but cobweb-learning.&mdash;<span class="smcap">J. Howell.</span>
<i>Familiar Letters.</i></p>


<h3>CHEWING THE CUD</h3>

<p>Reading furnishes the mind only with materials of
knowledge; it is thinking makes what we read ours. We
are of the ruminating kind, and it is not enough to cram
ourselves with a great load of collections; unless we chew
them over again they will not give us strength and nourishment....
The memory may be stored, but the judgement
is little better, and the stock of knowledge not increased, by
being able to repeat what others have said or produce the
arguments we have found in them. Such a knowledge as
this is but knowledge by hearsay, and the ostentation of it
is at best but talking by rote, and very often upon weak
and wrong principles. For all that is to be found in books
is not built upon true foundations, nor always rightly
deduced from the principles it is pretended to be built on....
The mind is backward in itself to be at the pains to trace
every argument to its original, and to see upon what basis
it stands, and how firmly; but yet it is this that gives so
much the advantage to one man more than another in
reading. The mind should, by severe rules, be tied down
to this at first uneasy task; use and exercise will give it
facility. So that those who are accustomed to it, readily,
as it were with one cast of the eye, take a view of the
argument, and presently, in most cases, see where it
bottoms. Those who have got this faculty, one may say,
have got the true key of books, and the clue to lead them
through the mizmaze of variety of opinions and authors to
truth and certainty. This young beginners should be
entered in, and showed the use of, that they might profit
by their reading.... This way of thinking on and profiting
by what we read will be a clog and rub to any one only in
the beginning; when custom and exercise has made it
familiar, it will be dispatched in most occasions, without
resting or interruption in the course of our reading.&mdash;<span class="smcap">J.
Locke.</span> <i>Conduct of the Understanding.</i></p>

<h3>READING ACCORDING TO INCLINATION</h3>

<p>He [Dr. Johnson] said, that for general improvement,
a man should read whatever his immediate inclination
prompts him to; though, to be sure, if a man has a science
to learn, he must regularly and resolutely advance. He
added, 'what we read with inclination makes a much
stronger impression. If we read without inclination, half
the mind is employed in fixing the attention; so there is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
but one half to be employed on what we read.' He told us,
he read Fielding's <i>Amelia</i> through without stopping. He
said, 'If a man begins to read in the middle of a book,
and feels an inclination to go on, let him not quit it, to
go to the beginning. He may perhaps not feel again the
inclination.'</p>

<p>Dr. Johnson advised me to-day, to have as many books
about me as I could; that I might read upon any subject
upon which I had a desire for instruction at the time. 'What
you read <i>then</i> (said he) you will remember; but if you have
not a book immediately ready, and the subject moulds in
your mind, it is a chance if you again have a desire to study
it.' He added, 'If a man never has an eager desire for
instruction, he should prescribe a task for himself. But it
is better when a man reads from immediate inclination.'</p>

<p>Another admonition of his was, never to go out without
some little book or other in the pocket. 'Much time,'
added he, 'is lost by waiting, by travelling, &amp;c., and this
may be prevented, by making use of every possible opportunity
for improvement.'&mdash;<span class="smcap">J. Boswell.</span> <i>Life of Johnson.</i></p>


<h3>READ FEW BOOKS WELL</h3>

<p>Read few books well. We forget names and dates; and
reproach our memory. They are of little consequence. We
feel our limbs enlarge and strengthen; yet cannot tell the
dinner or the dish that caused the alteration. Our minds
improve though we cannot name the author and have
forgotten the particulars.</p>

<p>Read all books through; and bad books most carefully,
lest you should lose one good thought, being determined
never to look into them again. A man may read a great
deal too much.&mdash;<span class="smcap">J. Horne Tooke.</span> <i>Recollections of
S. Rogers.</i></p>


<h3>BOOKS AS FRUITFUL TREES</h3>

<p>Under a strong persuasion that little of real value is
derived by persons in general from a wide and various
reading; but still more deeply convinced as to the actual
mischief of unconnected and promiscuous reading, and
that it is sure, in a greater or less degree, to enervate even
where it does not likewise inflate; I hope to satisfy many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
an ingenious mind, seriously interested in its own development
and cultivation, how moderate a number of volumes,
if only they be judiciously chosen, will suffice for the
attainment of every wise and desirable purpose; that is,
in addition to those which he studies for specific and
professional purposes. It is saying less than the truth to
affirm that an excellent book (and the remark holds almost
equally good of a Raphael as of a Milton) is like a well-chosen
and well-tended fruit-tree. Its fruits are not of one
season only. With the due and natural intervals, we may
recur to it year after year, and it will supply the same
nourishment and the same gratification, if only we ourselves
return to it with the same healthful appetite.&mdash;<span class="smcap">S.
T. Coleridge.</span> <i>Prospectus to a Course of Lectures.</i></p>


<h3>READING SEVERAL BOOKS AT A TIME</h3>

<p>The advice I would give to any one who is disposed
really to read for the sake of knowledge is, that he should
have two or three books in course of reading at the same
time. He will read a great deal more in that time and with
much greater profit. All travels are worth reading, as
subsidiary to reading, and in fact essential parts of it: old
or new, it matters not&mdash;something is to be learnt from all.
And the custom of making brief notes of reference to everything
of interest or importance would be exceedingly
useful.&mdash;<span class="smcap">R. Southey</span> (Letter to Henry Taylor).</p>


<h3>WHEN AND WHERE TO READ</h3>

<p>Much depends upon <i>when</i> and <i>where</i> you read a book. In
the five or six impatient minutes, before the dinner is quite
ready, who would think of taking up the <i>Fairy Queen</i> for
a stop-gap, or a volume of Bishop Andrewes' sermons?</p>

<p>Milton almost requires a solemn service of music to be
played before you enter upon him. But he brings his
music, to which, who listens, had need bring docile thoughts,
and purged ears.</p>

<p>Winter evenings&mdash;the world shut out&mdash;with less of ceremony
the gentle Shakespeare enters. At such a season,
the <i>Tempest</i>, or his own <i>Winter's Tale</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p>These two poets you cannot avoid reading aloud&mdash;to
yourself, or (as it chances) to some single person listening.
More than one&mdash;and it degenerates into an audience.</p>

<p>Books of quick interest, that hurry on for incidents, are
for the eye to glide over only. It will not do to read them
out. I could never listen to even the better kind of modern
novels without extreme irksomeness.</p>

<p>A newspaper, read out, is intolerable.&mdash;<span class="smcap">C. Lamb.</span> <i>Detached
Thoughts on Books and Reading.</i></p>


<h3>SMALL AUTHORS DANGEROUS</h3>

<p>It is dangerous to have any intercourse or dealing with
small authors. They are as troublesome to handle, as easy
to discompose, as difficult to pacify, and leave as unpleasant
marks on you, as small children. Cultivate on the other
hand the society and friendship of the higher; first that
you may learn to reverence them, which of itself is both
a pleasure and a virtue, and then that on proper occasions
you may defend them against the malevolent, which is
a duty. And this duty cannot be well and satisfactorily
performed with an imperfect knowledge, or with an inadequate
esteem.&mdash;<span class="smcap">W. S. Landor.</span> <i>Imaginary Conversations:
Barrow and Newton.</i></p>


<h3>BOOKS THAT PROVOKE THOUGHT</h3>

<p>It is wholesome and bracing for the mind, to have its
faculties kept on the stretch. It is like the effect of a walk
in Switzerland upon the body. Reading an Essay of
Bacon's, for instance, or a chapter of Aristotle or of Butler,
if it be well and thoughtfully read, is much like climbing up
a hill, and may do one the same sort of good.... For my
own part, I have ever gained the most profit and the
most pleasure also, from the books which have made me
think the most: and, when the difficulties have once been
overcome, these are the books which have struck the
deepest root, not only in my memory and understanding,
but likewise in my affections. For this point too should be
taken into account. We are wont to think slightly of that,
which it costs us a slight effort to win. When a maiden is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
too forward, her admirer deems it time to draw back.
Whereas whatever has associated itself with the arousal
and activity of our better nature, with the important and
memorable epochs in our lives, whether moral or intellectual,
is,&mdash;to cull a sprig from the beautiful passage in which
Wordsworth describes the growth of Michael's love for his
native hills&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i17">Our living being, even more<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Than our own blood,&mdash;and could it less?&mdash;retains<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Strong hold on our affections, is to us<br /></span>
<span class="i1">A pleasurable feeling of blind love,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The pleasure which there is in life itself.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>If you would fertilize the mind, the plough must be driven
over and through it. The gliding of wheels is easier and
rapider, but only makes it harder and more barren. Above
all, in the present age of light reading, that is, of reading
hastily, thoughtlessly, indiscriminately, unfruitfully, when
most books are forgotten as soon as they are finished, and
very many sooner, it is well if something heavier is cast
now and then into the midst of the literary public. This
may scare and repel the weak: it will rouse and attract
the stronger, and increase their strength by making them
exert it. In the sweat of the brow is the mind as well as
the body to eat its bread.&mdash;<span class="smcap">A. W.</span> and <span class="smcap">J. C. Hare.</span> <i>Guesses
at Truth.</i></p>


<h3>RULES FOR READING</h3>

<p>The best rule of reading will be a method from nature,
and not a mechanical one of hours and pages. It holds
each student to a pursuit of his native aim, instead of a
desultory miscellany. Let him read what is proper to him,
and not waste his memory on a crowd of mediocrities. As
whole nations have derived their culture from a single
book,&mdash;as the Bible has been the literature as well as the
religion of large portions of Europe,&mdash;as Hafiz was the
eminent genius of the Persians, Confucius of the Chinese,
Cervantes of the Spaniards; so, perhaps, the human mind
would be a gainer, if all the secondary writers were lost&mdash;say,
in England, all but Shakespeare, Milton, and Bacon&mdash;through
the profounder study so drawn to those wonderful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
minds. With this pilot of his own genius, let the student read
one, or let him read many, he will read advantageously....</p>

<p>The three practical rules, then, which I have to offer, are,&mdash;1.
Never read any book that is not a year old. 2. Never
read any but famed books. 3. Never read any but what
you like; or, in Shakespeare's phrase,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">No profit goes where is no pleasure ta'en:<br /></span>
<span class="i1">In brief, sir, study what you most affect.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Montaigne says, 'Books are a languid pleasure;' but
I find certain books vital and spermatic, not leaving the
reader what he was: he shuts the book a richer man.
I would never willingly read any others than such.&mdash;<span class="smcap">R.
W. Emerson.</span> <i>Books.</i></p>


<h3>A DIET OF BOOKS</h3>

<p>I would not be hurried by any love of system, by any
exaggeration of instincts, to underrate the Book. We all
know, that, as the human body can be nourished on any
food, though it were boiled grass and the broth of shoes, so
the human mind can be fed by any knowledge. And great
and heroic men have existed, who had almost no other
information than by the printed page. I only would say,
that it needs a strong head to bear that diet. One must be
an inventor to read well. As the proverb says, 'He that
would bring home the wealth of the Indies must carry out
the wealth of the Indies.' There is, then, creative reading
as well as creative writing. When the mind is braced by
labour and invention, the page of whatever book we read
becomes luminous with manifold allusion. Every sentence
is doubly significant, and the sense of our author is as broad
as the world. We then see, what is always true, that, as
the seer's hour of vision is short and rare among heavy days
and months, so is its record, perchance, the least part of
his volume. The discerning will read, in his Plato or
Shakespeare, only that least part,&mdash;only the authentic
utterances of the oracle; all the rest he rejects, were it never
so many times Plato's and Shakespeare's.&mdash;<span class="smcap">R. W. Emerson.</span>
<i>The American Scholar.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>


<h3>A COURSE OF READING</h3>

<p>Let us turn our attention to the intellectual advantages
accompanying the pursuit, since the proper function of
books is in the general case associated with intellectual
culture and occupation. It would seem that, according to
a received prejudice or opinion, there is one exception to
this general connexion, in the case of the possessors of
libraries, who are under a vehement suspicion of not reading
their books. Well, perhaps it is true in the sense in which
those who utter the taunt understand the reading of a book.
That one should possess no books beyond his power of
perusal&mdash;that he should buy no faster than as he can read
straight through what he has already bought&mdash;is a supposition
alike preposterous and unreasonable. 'Surely you
have far more books than you can read,' is sometimes the
inane remark of the barbarian who gets his books, volume
by volume, from some circulating library or reading club,
and reads them all through, one after the other, with
a dreary dutifulness, that he may be sure that he has got
the value of his money.</p>

<p>It is true that there are some books&mdash;as Homer, Virgil,
Horace, Milton, Shakespeare, and Scott&mdash;which every man
should read who has the opportunity&mdash;should read, mark,
learn, and inwardly digest.... But is one next to read
through the sixty and odd folio volumes of the Bollandist
<i>Lives of the Saints</i>, and the new edition of the Byzantine
historians, and the State Trials, and the <i>Encyclopaedia
Britannica</i>, and Moreri, and the Statutes at large, and the
<i>Gentleman's Magazine</i> from the beginning, each separately,
and in succession? Such a course of reading would certainly
do a good deal towards weakening the mind, if it did not
create absolute insanity.</p>

<p>But in all these just named, even in the Statutes at large,
and in thousands upon thousands of other books, there is
precious honey to be gathered by the literary busy bee, who
passes on from flower to flower. In fact, 'a course of
reading,' as it is sometimes called, is a course of regimen
for dwarfing the mind, like the drugs which dog-breeders
give to King Charles spaniels to keep them small. Within
the span of life allotted to man there is but a certain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
number of books that it is practicable to read through, and
it is not possible to make a selection that will not, in a
manner, wall in the mind from a free expansion over the
republic of letters. The being chained, as it were, to one
intellect in the perusal straight on of any large book, is
a sort of mental slavery superinducing imbecility. Even
Gibbon's <i>Decline and Fall</i>, luminous and comprehensive as
its philosophy is, and rapid and brilliant the narrative, will
become deleterious mental food if consumed straight
through without variety. It will be well to relieve it
occasionally with a little Boston's <i>Fourfold State</i>, or Hervey's
<i>Meditations</i>, or Sturm's <i>Reflections for Every Day in the
Year</i>, or <i>Don Juan</i>, or Ward's <i>History of Stoke-Upon-Trent</i>.&mdash;<span class="smcap">J.
H. Burton.</span> <i>The Book-Hunter.</i></p>

<h3>POETS AS COMMENTATORS</h3>

<p>I hold that no man can have any just conception of the
history of England who has not often read, and meditated,
and learnt to love the great poets of England. The greatest
of them, such as Chaucer, Shakespeare, Massinger, George
Herbert, Milton, Cowley, Dryden, Pope, and Burns, often
throw more rich and brilliant colours, and sometimes even
more clear and steady lights, on the times and doings of our
forefathers, than are to be gathered out of all the chroniclers
together, from the Venerable Bede to the philosophical
Hume. They are at least the greatest and best commentators
on those chroniclers.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Sir James Stephen.</span> <i>Desultory
and Systematic Reading.</i></p>


<h3>THE METHOD OF READING PROFANE HISTORY</h3>

<p>In perusal of history, first, provide you some writers in
chronology and cosmography. For if you be ignorant of
the times and places when and where the things you read
were done, it cannot choose but breed confusion in your
reading, and make you many times grossly to slip and
mistake in your discourse. When, therefore, you set to
your book, have by you Helvicus, his <i>Chronology</i>, and
a map of the country in which you are conversant; and
repair unto them to acquaint you with time and place, when
and where you are. If you be versing the ancient histories,
then provide you Ptolemy's maps, or Ortelius, his <i>Conatus
Geographici</i>: if the latter, then some of the modern cards....</p>

<p>Before you come to read the acts of any people, as those
that intend to go to bowls will first see and view the
ground upon which they are to play, so it shall not be
amiss for you first to take a general view of that ground,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
which you mean more particularly to traverse, by reading
some short epitome.... This will give you a general taste
of your business, and add light unto particular authors....</p>

<p>From the order of reading and the matters in reading to
be observed, we come to the method of observation. What
order we are for our best use to keep in entering our notes
into our paper-books.</p>

<p>The custom which hath most prevailed hitherto was
commonplacing, a thing at the first original very plain and
simple; but by after-times much increased, some augmenting
the number of the heads, others inventing quainter
forms of disposing them: till at length commonplace books
became like unto the Roman Breviary or Missal. It was
a great part of clerkship to know how to use them. The
vastness of the volumes, the multitude of heads, the intricacy
of disposition, the pains of committing the heads to
memory, and last, of the labour of so often turning the
books to enter the observations in their due places, are
things so expensive of time and industry, that although at
length the work comes to perfection, yet it is but like the
silver mines in Wales, the profit will hardly quit the pains.
I have often doubted with myself whether or no there were
any necessity of being so exactly methodical. First,
because there hath not yet been found a method of that
latitude, but little reading would furnish you with some
things, which would fall without the compass of it.
Secondly, because men of confused, dark and cloudy
understandings, no beam or light of order and method can
ever rectify; whereas men of clear understanding, though
but in a mediocrity, if they read good books carefully, and
note diligently, it is impossible but they should find incredible
profit, though their notes lie never so confusedly.
The strength of our natural memory, especially if we help
it, by revising our own notes; the nature of things themselves,
many times ordering themselves, and <i>tantum non</i>,
telling us how to range them; a mediocrity of care to see
that matters lie not too chaos-like, will with very small
damage save us this great labour of being over-superstitiously
methodical. And what though peradventure
something be lost, <i>Exilis domus est</i>, &amp;c. It is a sign of great
poverty of scholarship, where everything that is lost is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
missed; whereas rich and well-accomplished learning is
able to lose many things with little or no inconvenience.&mdash;<span class="smcap">J.
Hales.</span> <i>Golden Remains.</i></p>


<h3>EPITOMES</h3>

<p>Epitome is good privately for himself that doth work it,
but ill commonly for all other that use other men's labour
therein: a silly poor kind of study, not unlike to the doing
of those poor folk, which neither till nor sow nor reap
themselves, but glean by stealth upon other men's grounds.
Such have empty barns for dear years.... Epitome hurteth
most of all in divinity itself. Indeed books of commonplaces
be very necessary to induce a man into an orderly
general knowledge, how to refer orderly all that he readeth,
<i>ad certa rerum capita</i>, and not wander in study.... But to
dwell in epitomes, and books of commonplaces, and not
to bind himself daily by orderly study, to read with all
diligence, principally the holiest Scripture, and withal the
best doctors, and so to learn to make true difference betwixt
the authority of the one and the counsel of the other,
maketh so many seeming and sunburnt ministers as we
have; whose learning is gotten in a summer heat, and
washed away with a Christmas snow again.&mdash;<span class="smcap">R. Ascham.</span>
<i>The Schoolmaster.</i></p>


<h3>ABSTRACTS OF BOOKS</h3>

<p>My abstracts of each book were made in the French
language: my observations often branched into particular
essays; and I can still read, without contempt, a dissertation
of eight folio pages on eight lines (287-94) of the fourth
<i>Georgic</i> of Virgil....</p>

<p>This various reading, which I now conducted with discretion,
was digested, according to the precept and model
of Mr. Locke, into a large commonplace book; a practice,
however, which I do not strenuously recommend. The
action of the pen will doubtless imprint an idea on the
mind as well as on the paper: but I much question whether
the benefits of this laborious method are adequate to the
waste of time; and I must agree with Dr. Johnson (<i>Idler</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
No. 74), 'that what is twice read is commonly better remembered
than what is transcribed'....</p>

<p>I will embrace this occasion of recommending to the
young student a practice which about this time [1759] I
myself adopted. After glancing my eye over the design and
order of a new book, I suspended the perusal till I had
finished the task of self-examination, till I had revolved,
in a solitary walk, all that I knew, or believed, or had
thought on the subject of the whole work, or of some
particular chapter: I was then qualified to discern how
much the author added to my original stock; and if I was
sometimes satisfied by the agreement, I was sometimes
armed by the opposition of our ideas.&mdash;<span class="smcap">E. Gibbon.</span> <i>Autobiography.</i></p>


<h3>BESCRIBBLING WITH NOTES</h3>

<p>Somewhat to aid the weakness of my memory and to
assist her great defects; for it hath often been my chance
to light upon books which I supposed to be new and never
to have read, which I had, not understanding, diligently read
and run over many years before, and all bescribbled with my
notes: I have a while since accustomed myself to note at the
end of my book (I mean such as I purpose to read but once)
the time I made an end to read it, and to set down what
censure or judgement I gave of it; that so it may at least
at another time represent unto my mind the air and general
idea I had conceived of the author in reading him.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Montaigne.</span></p>


<h3>BOOKS TO BE MARKED</h3>

<p>If the books which you read are your own, mark with
a pen or pencil the most considerable things in them which
you desire to remember. Then you may read that book
the second time over with half the trouble, by your eye
running over the paragraphs which your pencil has noted.
It is but a very weak objection against this practice to say,
'I shall spoil my book;' for I persuade myself that you
did not buy it as a bookseller, to sell it again for gain, but
as a scholar, to improve your mind by it; and if the mind
be improved, your advantage is abundant, though your
book yields less money to your executors.&mdash;<span class="smcap">I. Watts.</span> <i>Logic.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>


<h3>UNDERSCORING</h3>

<p>'On a subsequent evening, when I called by invitation
to consult some other volumes, the conversation turned on
the practice of underscoring books of study. Sir William
spoke highly of the practice, as attended with many advantages,
especially in the saving of time and labour. Intelligent
underlining gave a kind of abstract of an important
work, and by the use of different coloured inks to mark
a difference of contents, and discriminate the doctrinal from
the historical or illustrative elements of an argument or
exposition, the abstract became an analysis very serviceable
for ready reference. He mentioned that this principle had
been carried to a ludicrous extreme in the publication of
a coloured New Testament by an Anglicized German, Wirgmann
by name.... In this book, entitled <i>Divarication of
the New Testament into Doctrine and History</i>, the pages were
all coloured, most of them parti-coloured, the doctrine
being throughout visually separated from the history by
this device; the doctrine being, if I remember rightly,
blue, and the history red. The author expressed his belief
that all the sects of Christendom had arisen from a confusion
of these elements, and that his grand discovery in
the "Divarication" would annihilate sects, establish pure
Christianity as a sacred science, and become hereafter a
Euclid in Theology.'&mdash;<span class="smcap">Sir William Hamilton.</span> <i>Life</i> by
J. Veitch.</p>


<h3>THE PARSON'S ACCESSORY KNOWLEDGE</h3>

<p>The Country Parson hath read the Fathers also, and the
Schoolmen, and the later writers, or a good proportion of

yet every man's own is fittest, readiest, and most
savoury to him. Besides, this being to be done in his

to look upon his well-spent hours.&mdash;<span class="smcap">G. Herbert.</span> <i>A Priest

<h3>COMMONPLACE BOOKS</h3>

<p>For the disposition and collocation of that knowledge
which we preserve in writing, it consisteth in a good digest
of commonplaces, wherein I am not ignorant of the prejudice
imputed to the rise of commonplace books, as causing
a retardation of reading, and some sloth or relaxation of
memory. But because it is but a counterfeit thing in
knowledges to be forward and pregnant, except a man be
deep and full, I hold the entry of commonplaces to be
a matter of great use and essence in studying, as that which
assureth copy of invention, and contracteth judgement to
a strength. But this is true, that of the methods of commonplaces
that I have seen, there is none of any sufficient worth:
all of them carrying merely the face of a school, and not
of a world; and referring to vulgar matters and pedantical
divisions, without all life or respect to action.&mdash;<span class="smcap">F. Bacon,
Lord Verulam.</span> <i>Of the Advancement of Learning.</i></p>


<h3>A NEW METHOD OF A COMMONPLACE BOOK</h3>

<p>I take a paper book of what size I please. I divide the
two first pages that face one another by parallel lines into
five-and-twenty equal parts, every fifth line black, the
other red. I then cut them perpendicularly by other lines
that I draw from the top to the bottom of the page. I put
about the middle of each five spaces one of the twenty
letters I design to make use of, and, a little forward in
each space, the five vowels, one below another, in their
natural order. This is the index to the whole volume, how
big soever it may be.</p>

<p>The index being made after this manner, I leave a margin
in all the other pages of the book, of about the largeness
of an inch, in a volume in folio, or a little larger; and,
in a less volume, smaller in proportion.</p>

<p>If I would put anything in my Commonplace Book, I find
out a head to which I may refer it. Each head ought to
be some important and essential word to the matter in
hand, and in that word regard is to be had to the first
letter, and the vowel that follows it; for upon these two
letters depends all the use of the index.</p>

<p>I omit three letters of the alphabet as of no use to me,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
viz. K, Y, W, which are supplied by C, I, U, that are
equivalent to them. I put the letter Q that is always
followed with an u in the fifth space of Z. By throwing
Q last in my index, I preserve the regularity of my index,
and diminish not in the least its extent; for it seldom
happens that there is any head begins with Zu. I have
found none in the five-and-twenty years I have used this
method.... When I meet with anything that I think fit
to put into my commonplace book, I first find a proper
head. Suppose, for example, that the head be <span class="smcap">Epistola</span>,
I look into the index for the first letter and the following
vowel, which in this instance are E i; if in the space
marked E i there is any number that directs me to the
page designed for words that begin with an E, and whose
first vowel after the initial letter is I, I must then write
under the word Epistola, in that page, what I have to
remark. I write the head in large letters and begin a little
way out into the margin, and I continue on the line, in
writing what I have to say. I observe constantly this rule
that only the head appears in the margin, and that it be
continued on, without ever doubling the line in the margin,
by which means the heads will be obvious at first sight....</p>

<p>If the head is a monosyllable and begins with a vowel,
that vowel is at the same time both the first letter of the
word and the characteristic vowel. Therefore I write the
word Ars in A a and Os in O o....</p>

<p>As to the language in which one ought to express the
heads I esteem the Latin tongue most commodious, provided
the nominative case be always kept to.... But it
is not of much consequence what language is made use of,
provided there be no mixture in the heads of different
languages.&mdash;<span class="smcap">W. Locke</span> (Letter to Mr. Toignard).<br /><br /></p>


<p>A commonplace book contains many notions in garrison,
whence the owner may draw out an army into the field on
competent warning.&mdash;<span class="smcap">T. Fuller.</span> <i>The Holy and the Profane
State.</i><br /><br /></p>


<p>Reading without thinking may indeed make a rich
commonplace, but 'twill never make a clear head.&mdash;<span class="smcap">J.
Norris.</span> <i>On the Advantages of Thinking.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>


<h3>MARGINAL NOTES AND COMMONPLACE BOOKS</h3>

<p>It is the practice of many readers to note, in the margin
of their books, the most important passages, the strongest
arguments, or the brightest sentiments. Thus they load
their minds with superfluous attention, repress the vehemence
of curiosity by useless deliberation, and by frequent
interruption break the current of narration or the chain of
reason, and at last close the volume, and forget the passages
and marks together.</p>

<p>Others I have found unalterably persuaded that nothing
is certainly remembered but what is transcribed; and they
have therefore passed weeks and months in transferring
large quotations to a commonplace book. Yet, why any
part of a book, which can be consulted at pleasure, should
be copied, I was never able to discover. The hand has no
closer correspondence with the memory than the eye. The
act of writing itself distracts the thoughts, and what is
read twice is commonly better remembered than what is
transcribed. This method therefore consumes time without
assisting memory.</p>

<p>The true art of memory is the art of attention. No man
will read with much advantage, who is not able, at pleasure,
to evacuate his mind, or who brings not to his author an
intellect defecated and pure, neither turbid with care, nor
agitated by pleasure. If the repositories of thought are
already full, what can they receive? If the mind is employed
on the past or the future, the book will be held
before the eyes in vain. What is read with delight is commonly
retained, because pleasure always secures attention:
but the books which are consulted by occasional necessity,
and perused with impatience, seldom leave any traces on
the mind.&mdash;<span class="smcap">S. Johnson.</span> <i>Idler</i>, 74.</p>


<h3>THE BEE AND THE BUTTERFLY</h3>

<p>More is got from one book on which the thought settles
for a definite end in knowledge, than from libraries skimmed
over by a wandering eye. A cottage flower gives honey to
the bee, a king's garden none to the butterfly.&mdash;<span class="smcap">E. G. E. L.
Bulwer-Lytton, Lord Lytton.</span> <i>Caxtoniana.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>


<h3>SKIPPING WIT</h3>

<p>I do not search and toss over books, but for an honester
recreation to please, and pastime to delight myself: or if
I study, I only endeavour to find out the knowledge that
teacheth or handleth the knowledge of myself, and which
may instruct me how to die well and how to live well.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">Has meus ad metas sudet oportet equus (Propertius).<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">My horse must sweating run,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">That this goal may be won.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>If in reading I fortune to meet with any difficult points,
I fret not myself about them, but after I have given them
a charge or two, I leave them as I found them. Should
I earnestly plod upon them, I should lose both time and
myself, for I have a skipping wit. What I see not at the
first view, I shall less see it if I opinionate myself upon it.
I do nothing without blitheness; and an over-obstinate
continuation and plodding contention doth dazzle, dull, and
weary the same: my sight is thereby confounded and
diminished.... If one book seem tedious unto me I take
another, which I follow not with any earnestness, except
it be at such hours as I am idle, or that I am weary with
doing nothing. I am not greatly affected to new books,
because ancient authors are, in my judgement, more full
and pithy: nor am I much addicted to Greek books,
forasmuch as my understanding cannot well rid his work
with a childish and apprentice intelligence. Amongst
modern books merely pleasant, I esteem Boccaccio his
<i>Decameron</i>, Rabelais, and the Kisses of John the Second
(if they may be placed under this title), worth the pains-taking
to read them. As for <i>Amadis</i> and such like trash of
writings, they had never the credit so much as to allure
my youth to delight in them. This I will say more, either
boldly or rashly, that this old and heavy-paced mind of
mine will no more be pleased with Aristotle, or tickled with
good Ovid: his facility and quaint inventions which heretofore
have so ravished me, they can nowadays scarcely
entertain me.... It is neither grammatical subtilties nor
logical quiddities, nor the witty contexture of choice words
or arguments and syllogisms that will serve my turn....
I would not have a man go about and labour by circum<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>locutions
to induce and win me to attention, and that (as
our heralds or criers do) they shall ring out their words:
Now hear me, now listen, or ho-yes. The Romans in their
religion were wont to say 'Hoc age'; which in ours we say
'Sursum corda'. These are so many lost words for me.
I come ready prepared from my house. I need no allurement
nor sauce, my stomach is good enough to digest raw
meat.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Montaigne.</span></p>


<h3>CHANCE READINGS</h3>

</div></div>

<p>It is the custom of the Mahometans, if they see any
printed or written paper upon the ground, to take it up and
lay it aside carefully, as not knowing but it may contain
some piece of their Alcoran. I must confess I have so
much of the Mussulman in me, that I cannot forbear looking
into every printed paper which comes in my way, under
whatsoever despicable circumstances it may appear; for
as no mortal author, in the ordinary fate and vicissitude of
things, knows to what use his works may some time or
other be applied, a man may often meet with very celebrated
names in a paper of tobacco. I have lighted my
pipe more than once with the writings of a prelate; and
know a friend of mine, who, for these several years, has
converted the essays of a man of quality into a kind of
fringe for his candlesticks. I remember in particular, after
having read over a poem of an eminent author on a victory,
I met with several fragments of it upon the next rejoicing
day, which had been employed in squibs and crackers, and
by that means celebrated its subject in a double capacity.
I once met with a page of Mr. Baxter under a Christmas
pie. Whether or no the pastry-cook had made use of it
through chance or waggery, for the defence of that superstitious
<i>viande</i>, I know not; but upon the perusal of it,
I conceived so good an idea of the author's piety, that
I bought the whole book. I have often profited by these
accidental readings, and have sometimes found very curious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
pieces, that are either out of print, or not to be met with in
the shops of our London booksellers. For this reason, when
my friends take a survey of my library, they are very much
surprised to find, upon the shelf of folios, two long band-boxes
standing upright among my books, till I let them see
that they are both of them lined with deep erudition and
abstruse literature.&mdash;<span class="smcap">J. Addison.</span> <i>Spectator</i>, 85.</p>


<h3>RIDING POST</h3>

<p>In opposition to these extremes, I meet with another sort
of people, that delight themselves in reading, but it is in
such a desultory way, running from one book to another,
as birds skip from one bough to another, without design,
that it is no marvel if they get nothing but their labour
for their pains, when they seek nothing but change and
diversion: they that ride post can observe but little.</p>

<p>It is in reading, as it is in making many books; there
may be a pleasing distraction in it, but little or no profit.
I would therefore do in this as merchants used to do in
their trading; who, in a coasting way, put in at several
ports and take in what commodities they afford, but settle
their factories in those places only which are of special note:
I would, by the by, allow myself a traffic with sundry authors,
as I happen to light upon them, for my recreation; and
I would make the best advantage that I could of them; but
I would fix my study upon those only that are of most
importance to fit me for action, which is the true end of all
learning, and for the service of God, which is the true end
of all action. Lord, teach me so to study other men's works
as not to neglect mine own; and so to study Thy word,
which is Thy work, that it may be 'a lamp unto my feet,
and a light unto my path'&mdash;my candle to work by. Take
me off from the curiosity of knowing only to know; from
the vanity of knowing only to be known; and from the
folly of pretending to know more than I do know; and
let it be my wisdom to study to know Thee, who art life
eternal. Write Thy law in my heart, and I shall be the best
book here.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Sir W. Waller.</span> <i>Divine Meditations.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>


<h3>APPETITE AND SATIETY</h3>

<p>The library at Waverley-Honour, a large Gothic room,
with double arches and a gallery, contained such a miscellaneous
and extensive collection of volumes as had been
assembled together, during the course of two hundred
years, by a family which had been always wealthy, and
inclined, of course, as a mark of splendour, to furnish their
shelves with the current literature of the day, without much
scrutiny, or nicety of discrimination. Throughout this
ample realm Edward was permitted to roam at large....
With a desire of amusement, therefore, which better
discipline might soon have converted into a thirst for
knowledge, young Waverley drove through the sea of
books, like a vessel without a pilot or a rudder. Nothing
perhaps increases by indulgence more than a desultory
habit of reading, especially under such opportunities of
gratifying it. I believe one reason why such numerous
instances of erudition occur among the lower ranks is, that,
with the same powers of mind, the poor student is limited
to a narrow circle for indulging his passion for books, and
must necessarily make himself master of the few he possesses
ere he can acquire more. Edward, on the contrary, like the
epicure who only deigned to take a single morsel from the
sunny side of a peach, read no volume a moment after it
ceased to excite his curiosity or interest; and it necessarily
happened, that the habit of seeking only this sort of gratification
rendered it daily more difficult of attainment, till the
passion for reading, like other strong appetites, produced
by indulgence a sort of satiety.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Sir W. Scott.</span> <i>Waverley.</i></p>


<h3>THE HABIT OF CASUAL READING</h3>

<p>Not to mention the multitudes who read merely for the
sake of talking, or to qualify themselves for the world, or
some such kind of reasons; there are, even of the few who
read for their own entertainment, and have a real curiosity
to see what is said, several, which is prodigious, who have
no sort of curiosity to see what is true....</p>

<p>For the sake of this whole class of readers, for they are
of different capacities, different kinds, and get into this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
way from different occasions, I have often wished that it
had been the custom to lay before people nothing in matters
of argument but premises, and leave them to draw conclusions
themselves; which, though it could not be done in
all cases, might in many.</p>

<p>The great number of books and papers of amusement,
which, of one kind or another, daily come in one's way,
have in part occasioned, and most perfectly fall in with and
humour, this idle way of reading and considering things.
By this means, time even in solitude is happily got rid of,
without the pain of attention; neither is any part of it
more put to the account of idleness, one can scarce forbear
saying, is spent with less thought, than great part of that
which is spent in reading.&mdash;<span class="smcap">J. Butler.</span> Preface to <i>Sermons</i>.</p>


<h3>JOHNSON'S CURSORY READING</h3>

<p>Mr. Elphinston talked of a new book that was much
admired, and asked Dr. Johnson if he had read it. Johnson:
'I have looked into it.' 'What (said Elphinston), have you
not read it through?' Johnson, offended at being thus
pressed, and so obliged to own his cursory mode of reading,
answered tartly, 'No, Sir, do <i>you</i> read books <i>through</i>?'&mdash;<span class="smcap">J.
Boswell.</span> <i>Life of Johnson.</i></p>


<h3>DESULTORY READING</h3>

<p>Desultory reading is indeed very mischievous, by
fostering habits of loose, discontinuous thought, by turning
the memory into a common sewer for rubbish of all sorts to
float through, and by relaxing the power of attention,
which of all our faculties most needs care, and is most
improved by it. But a well-regulated course of study will
no more weaken the mind, than hard exercise will weaken
the body: nor will a strong understanding be weighed down
by its knowledge, any more than an oak is by its leaves,
or than Samson was by his locks. He whose sinews are
drained by his hair, must already be a weakling.&mdash;A. W. and
<span class="smcap">J. C. Hare</span>. <i>Guesses at Truth.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>


<h3>THE GREATEST CLERKS BE NOT ALWAYS THE WISEST MEN</h3>

<p>As in the choice and reading of good books principally
consists the enabling and advancement of a man's knowledge
and learning; yet if it be not mixed with the conversation
of discreet, able, and understanding men, they can
make little use of their reading, either for themselves, or the
commonwealth where they live. There is not a more
common proverb than this, <i>That the Greatest Clerks be not
always the wisest men</i>, and reason for it, being a very uneven
rule to square all actions, and consultations, only by book
precedents. Time hath so many changes, and alterations,
and such variety of occasions and opportunities, intervening,
and mingled, that it is impossible to go new ways in the
old paths; so that though reading do furnish and direct
a man's judgement, yet it doth not wholly govern it. Therefore
the necessity of knowing the present time, and men,
wherein we live, is so great, that it is the principal guide of
our actions, and reading but supplemental.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Grey Brydges,
Lord Chandos.</span> <i>Horae Subsecivae.</i></p>


<h3>A BOOKISH AMBITION</h3>

<p>Affect not, as some do, that bookish ambition, to be
stored with books and have well-furnished libraries, yet
keep their heads empty of knowledge: to desire to have
many books, and never to use them, is like a child that will
have a candle burning by him, all the while he is sleeping.&mdash;<span class="smcap">H.
Peacham.</span> <i>The Compleat Gentleman.</i></p>


<h3>FULL LIBRARIES AND EMPTY HEADS</h3>

<p>We have a generation of people in the world, that are so
far from putting themselves upon the hazard of knowing
too much, that they affect a kind of Socratical knowledge
(though it be the clear contrary way), a knowledge of knowing
nothing; they hate learning, and wisdom, and understanding
with that perfect hatred, that if one could fancy
such things to be in paradise, one would think (if I may
speak it, as I mean it without profaneness) that the Devil
could not tempt them to come near the tree of knowledge;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
I cannot say these are in a state of innocency, but I am sure
they are in a state of simplicity. But among those few
persons (especially those of quality) that pretend to look
after books, how many are there that affect rather to look
upon them, than in them? Some covet to have libraries
in their houses, as ladies desire to have cupboards of plate
in their chambers, only for show; as if they were only to
furnish their rooms, and not their minds; if the only having
of store of books were sufficient to improve a man, the
stationers would have the advantage of all others; but
certainly books were made for use, and not for ostentation;
in vain do they boast of full libraries that are contented
to live with empty heads.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Sir W. Waller.</span> <i>Divine

<h3>READING TO KILL TIME</h3>

<p>As to the devotees of the circulating libraries, I dare not
compliment their <i>pass-time</i>, or rather <i>kill-time</i>, with the
name of <i>reading</i>. Call it rather a sort of beggarly daydreaming,
during which the mind of the dreamer furnishes
for itself nothing but laziness and a little mawkish sensibility;
while the whole <i>material</i> and imagery of the doze
is supplied <i>ab extra</i> by a sort of mental <i>camera obscura</i>
manufactured at the printing office, which <i>pro tempore</i> fixes,
reflects and transmits the moving phantasms of one man's
delirium, so as to people the barrenness of an hundred
other brains afflicted with the same trance or suspension of
all common sense and all definite purpose. We should
therefore transfer this species of <i>amusement</i> (if indeed those
can be said to retire <i>a musis</i>, who were never in their company,
or relaxation be attributable to those whose bows are
never bent) from the genus <i>reading</i> to the comprehensive
class characterized by the power of reconciling the two
contrary yet co-existing propensities of human nature,
namely, indulgence of sloth and hatred of vacancy. In
addition to novels and tales of chivalry in prose or rhyme
(by which last I mean neither rhythm nor metre) this genus
comprises as its species gaming, swinging, or swaying on
a chair or gate; spitting over a bridge; smoking; snuff-taking;
<i>tête à tête</i> quarrels after dinner between husband
and wife; conning word by word all the advertisements
of the daily advertizers in a public-house on a rainy day,
&amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c.&mdash;<span class="smcap">S. T. Coleridge.</span> <i>Biographia Literaria.</i></p>


<h3>TALKING FROM BOOKS</h3>

<p>Dr. Johnson this day, when we were by ourselves [on
the journey to the Hebrides] observed, how common it was
for people to talk from books; to retail the sentiments of
others, and not their own; in short, to converse without
any originality of thinking. He was pleased to say, 'You
and I do not talk from books.'&mdash;<span class="smcap">J. Boswell.</span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span> <i>Life of
Johnson.</i><br /><br /></p>


<p>There are no race of people who talk about books, or
perhaps, who read books, so little as literary men.&mdash;<span class="smcap">W. M.
Thackeray.</span></p>


<h3>A SHORT CUT TO FAME</h3>

<p>There is a sort of vanity some men have, of talking of
and reading obscure and half-forgotten authors, because
it passes as a matter of course, that he who quotes authors
which are so little read, must be completely and thoroughly
acquainted with those authors which are in every man's
mouth. For instance, it is very common to quote Shakespeare;
but it makes a sort of stare to quote Massinger.
I have very little credit for being well acquainted with
Virgil; but if I quote Silius Italicus, I may stand some
chance of being reckoned a great scholar. In short, whoever
wishes to strike out of the great road, and to make a short
cut to fame, let him neglect Homer, and Virgil, and Horace,
and Ariosto and Milton, and, instead of these, read and talk
of Frascatorius, Sannazarius, Lorenzini, Pastorini, and the
thirty-six primary sonneteers of Bettinelli;&mdash;let him neglect
everything which the suffrage of ages has made venerable
and grand, and dig out of their graves a set of decayed
scribblers, whom the silent verdict of the public has fairly
condemned to everlasting oblivion. If he complain of the
injustice with which they have been treated, and call for
a new trial with loud and importunate clamour, though
I am afraid he will not make much progress in the estimation
of men of sense, he will be sure to make some noise
in the crowd, and to be dubbed a man of very curious and
extraordinary erudition.&mdash;<span class="smcap">S. Smith.</span> <i>Moral Philosophy,
Lecture IX. On the Conduct of the Understanding.</i></p>


<h3>TITLE-READERS</h3>

<p>Some read to think,&mdash;these are rare; some to write,&mdash;these
are common; and some read to talk,&mdash;and these form
the great majority. The first page of an author not unfrequently
suffices for all the purposes of this latter class:
of whom it has been said, that they treat books as some do
lords; they inform themselves of their <i>titles</i>, and then
boast of an intimate acquaintance.&mdash;<span class="smcap">C. C. Colton.</span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span> <i>Lacon.</i><br /><br /></p>

as bad as a mother who talks about her own children.&mdash;<span class="smcap">B.

<h3>THE BURNING OF DON QUIXOTE'S BOOKS</h3>

<p>The priest and the barber of the place, who were
Don Quixote's great friends, happened to be there [at Don
Quixote's house]; and the housekeeper was saying to them
aloud: What is your opinion, Señor Licentiate Pero Perez
(for that was the priest's name) of my master's misfortune?
for neither he, nor his horse, nor the target, nor the lance,
nor the armour have been seen these six days past. Woe
is me! I am verily persuaded, and it is as certainly true
as I was born to die, that these cursed books of knight-errantry
which he keeps, and is so often reading, have
turned his brain; and now I think of it, I have often heard
him say, talking to himself, that he would turn knight-errant,
and go about the world in quest of adventures.
The devil and Barabbas take all such books, that have thus
spoiled the finest understanding in all La Mancha. The
niece joined with her, and said moreover: Know, master
Nicholas (for that was the barber's name), that it has often
happened, that my honoured uncle has continued poring
on these confounded books of disadventures two whole days
and nights.... But I take the blame of all this to myself,
that I did not advertise you, gentlemen, of my dear uncle's
extravagances, before they were come to the height that
they now are, that you might have prevented them by
burning all those cursed books, of which he has so great
a store, and which as justly deserve to be committed to
the flames, as if they were heretical....</p>

<p>Whilst Don Quixote still slept on, the priest asked the
niece for the keys of the chamber where the books were,
those authors of the mischief; and she delivered them with
a very good will. They all went in, and the housekeeper
with them. They found above a hundred volumes in folio,
very well bound, besides a great many small ones. And no
sooner did the housekeeper see them, than she ran out of the
room in great haste, and immediately returned with a pot
of holy water and a bunch of hyssop, and said: Señor
Licentiate, take this and sprinkle the room, lest some
enchanter, of the many these books abound with, should
enchant us in revenge for what we intend to do, in banishing
them out of the world. The priest smiled at the housekeeper's
simplicity, and ordered the barber to reach him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
the books one by one, that they might see what they
treated of; for, perhaps, they might find some that might
not deserve to be chastised by fire. No, said the niece,
there is no reason why any of them should be spared....
The housekeeper said the same; so eagerly did they both
thirst for the death of those innocents. But the priest would
not agree to that, without first reading the titles at least....</p>

<p>That night the housekeeper set fire to, and burnt all
the books that were in the yard [whither they had been
cast], and in the house too; and some must have perished,
that deserved to be treasured up in perpetual archives.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Cervantes.</span>
<i>Don Quixote.</i></p>


<h3>BRAINS SQUASHED BY BOOKS</h3>

<p>There have indeed been minds overlaid by much reading,
men who have piled such a load of books on their heads, their
brains have seemed to be squashed by them.&mdash;A. W. and
<span class="smcap">J. C. Hare.</span> <i>Guesses at Truth.</i></p>


<h3>FOLLY GENERATED BY BOOKS</h3>

<p>Books are chiefly useful as they help us to interpret what
we see and experience. When they absorb men, as they
sometimes do, and turn them from observation of nature
and life, they generate a learned folly, for which the plain
sense of the labourer could not be exchanged but at great
loss. It deserves attention that the greatest men have been
formed without the studies which at present are thought
by many most needful to improvement. Homer, Plato,
Demosthenes, never heard the name of chemistry, and
knew less of the solar system than a boy in our common
schools. Not that these sciences are unimportant; but
the lesson is, that human improvement never wants the
means, where the purpose of it is deep and earnest in the
soul.&mdash;<span class="smcap">W. E. Channing.</span> <i>Self-Culture.</i></p>

<h3>OVER-READING</h3>

<p>As for the disgraces which learning receiveth from
politics, they be of this nature; that learning doth soften
men's minds, and makes them more unapt for the honour
and exercise of arms; that it doth mar and pervert men's
dispositions for matter of government and policy, in
making them too curious and irresolute by variety of
reading, or too peremptory or positive by strictness of rules
and axioms, or too immoderate and overweening by reason
of the greatness of examples, or too incompatible and
differing from the times by reason of the dissimilitude of
examples; or at least, that it doth divert men's travails
from action and business, and bringeth them to a love of
leisure and privateness; and that it doth bring into states
a relaxation of discipline, whilst every man is more ready
to argue than to obey and execute....</p>

<p>If any man be laborious in reading and study and yet idle
in business and action, it groweth from some weakness of
body or softness of spirit; such as Seneca speaketh of:
<i>Quidam tam sunt umbratiles, ut putent in turbido esse quicquid
in luce est</i>; and not of learning: well may it be that such
a point of a man's nature may make him give himself to
learning, but it is not learning that breedeth any such point
in his nature.&mdash;<span class="smcap">F. Bacon, Lord Verulam.</span> <i>Of the Advancement
of Learning.</i></p>

<i>reading too much</i>, or out of proportion to what we <i>think</i>.
I should be wiser, I am persuaded, if I had not read half
as much&mdash;should have had stronger and better exercised
faculties. The fact is, that the <i>ne plus ultra</i> of intellectual
indolence is this reading of books. It comes next to what

<h3>THE MESSAGE OF BOOKS</h3>

<p>If books are only dead things, if they do not speak to
one, or answer one when one speaks to them, if they have
nothing to do with the common things that we are busy
with&mdash;with the sky over our head, and the ground under
our feet&mdash;I think that they had better stay on the shelves....
What I regret is that many of us spend much of our time
in reading books, and in talking of books&mdash;that we like
nothing worse than the reputation of being indifferent to
them, and nothing better than the reputation of knowing
a great deal about them; and yet that, after all, we do not
know them in the same way as we know our fellow-creatures,
not even in the way we know any dumb animal that we walk
with or play with. This is a great misfortune, in my opinion,
and one which I am afraid is increasing as what we call<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
'the taste for literature' increases. It is very pleasant to
think in what distant parts of the earth it [the English
language] is spoken, and that in all those parts these books
which are friends of ours are acknowledged as friends. And
there is a living and productive power in them. They have
produced an American literature, which is coming back to
instruct us. They will produce by and by an Australian
literature, which will be worth all the gold that is sent to
us from the diggings.&mdash;<span class="smcap">F. D. Maurice.</span> <i>The Friendship of
Books.</i></p>


<h3>OVERRATING THE VIRTUE OF BOOKS</h3>

<p>In modern times instruction is communicated chiefly by
means of Books. Books are no doubt very useful helps to
knowledge, and in some measure also, to the practice of
useful arts and accomplishments, but they are not, in any
case, the primary and natural sources of culture, and, in
my opinion, their virtue is not a little apt to be overrated,
even in those branches of acquirement where they seem
most indispensable. They are not creative powers in any
sense; they are merely helps, instruments, tools; and even
as tools they are only artificial tools, superadded to those
with which the wise prevision of Nature has equipped us,
like telescopes and microscopes, whose assistance in many
researches reveals unimagined wonders, but the use of which
should never tempt us to undervalue or to neglect the
exercise of our own eyes. The original and proper sources
of knowledge are not books, but life, experience, personal
thinking, feeling, and acting. When a man starts with
these, books can fill up many gaps, correct much that is
inaccurate, and extend much that is inadequate; but,
without living experience to work on, books are like rain
and sunshine fallen on unbroken soil.&mdash;<span class="smcap">J. S. Blackie.</span> <i>On

<h3>BOOKS AN ENEMY TO HEALTH</h3>

<p>This plodding occupation of books is as painful as any
other, and as great an enemy unto health, which ought
principally to be considered. And a man should not suffer
himself to be inveigled by the pleasure he takes in them....
Books are delightful; but if by continual frequenting them,
we in the end lose both health and cheerfulness (our best
parts) let us leave them. I am one of those who think their
fruit can no way countervail this loss.... As for me, I love
no books but such as are pleasant and easy, and which
tickle me, or such as comfort or counsel me, to direct my
life and death....</p>

<p>If any say to me, It is a kind of vilifying the Muses to
use them only for sport and recreation, he wots not as I do,
what worth, pleasure, sport, and pastime is of: I had well
nigh termed all other ends ridiculous. I live from hand to
mouth, and, with reverence be it spoken, I live but to myself:
there end all my designs. Being young I studied for
ostentation; then a little to enable myself and become
wiser; now for delight and recreation, never for gain....
Books have and contain divers pleasing qualities to those
that can duly choose them. But no good without pains;
no roses without prickles. It is a pleasure not absolutely
pure and neat; no more than all others; it hath his inconveniences
attending on it, and sometimes weighty ones:
the mind is therein exercised, but the body (the care whereof
I have not yet forgotten) remaineth there&mdash;whilst without
action, and is wasted, and ensorrowed. I know no excess
more hurtful for me, nor more to be avoided by me, in this
declining age.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Montaigne.</span></p>

<h3>WHEN TO READ</h3>

<p>'Tis an honest injury to nature to steal from her some
hours of repose; unsufferable to the soul to let the golden
hours of the morning pass without advantage, seeing she
is then more capable of culture, and seems to be renewed
as well as the day. It were an excellent posture to paint
Caesar in, as he swum with a book in the one hand, and
a sword in the other; since he made his tent an academy,
and was at leisure to read the physiognomy of the heavens
in military tumults. This shows he knew how to prize
time, and hated idleness as much as a superior; and indeed,
to speak to Christians, we ought to look how we spend our
hours here, knowing they are but the preludium of that
which shall be no time but Eternity.</p>

<p>Judgement is long ere it be settled, experience being the
best nurse of it, and we see seldom learning and wisdom
concur, because the former is got <i>sub umbra</i>, but business
doth winnow observations, and the better acquaintance
with breathing volumes of men; it teacheth us both better
to read them and to apply what we have read....</p>

<p>Health ought to be nicely respected by a student. For
the labours of the mind are as far beyond them of the body,
as the diseases of the one are above the other; and how can
a spirit actuate when she is caged in a lump of fainting
flesh? Unseasonable times of study are very obnoxious,
as after meals, when Nature is wholly retired to concoction;
or at night times, when she begins to droop for want of
rest, hence so many rheums, defluxions, catarrhs, &amp;c., that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
I have heard it spoken of one of the greatest ambulatory
pieces of learning at this day, that he would redeem (if
possible) his health with the loss of half his learning.&mdash;<span class="smcap">John
Hall.</span> <i>Horae Vacivae.</i></p>


<h3>BOOKS INSTEAD OF STIMULANTS</h3>

<p>I know what it is to have had to toil when the brain was
throbbing, the mind incapable of originating a thought,
and the body worn and sore with exhaustion; and I know
what it is in such an hour, instead of having recourse to
those gross stimulants to which all worn men, both of the
higher and lower classes, are tempted, to take down my
Sophocles or my Plato (for Plato was a poet), my Goethe,
or my Dante, Shakespeare, Shelley, Wordsworth, or Tennyson;
and I know what it is to feel the jar of nerve gradually
cease, and the darkness in which all life had robed itself
to the imagination become light, discord pass into harmony,
and physical exhaustion rise by degrees into a consciousness
of power.&mdash;<span class="smcap">F. W. Robertson.</span> <i>Lectures and Addresses.</i></p>


<h3>THE PHARMACY OF BOOKS</h3>

<p>Books, taken indiscriminately, are no cure to the diseases
and afflictions of the mind. There is a world of science
necessary in the taking them. I have known some people
in great sorrow fly to a novel or the last light book in fashion.
One might as well take a rose-draught for the plague!
Light reading does not do when the heart is really heavy.
I am told that Goethe, when he lost his son, took to study
a science that was new to him. Ah! Goethe was a physician
who knew what he was about. In a great grief like this you
cannot tickle and divert the mind; you must wrench it
away, abstract, absorb&mdash;bury it in an abyss, hurry it into
a labyrinth. Therefore, for the irremediable sorrows of
middle life and old age, I recommended a strict chronic
course of science and hard reasoning&mdash;counter-irritation.
Bring the brain to act upon the heart! If science is too
much against the grain (for we have not all got mathematical
heads), something in the reach of the humblest
understanding, but sufficiently searching to the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
highest&mdash;new language&mdash;Greek, Arabic, Scandinavian, Chinese, or
Welsh! For the loss of fortune the dose should be applied
less directly to the understanding&mdash;I would administer
something elegant and cordial. For as the heart is crushed
and lacerated by a loss in the affections, so it is rather the
head that aches and suffers by the loss of money. Here we
find the higher class of poets a very valuable remedy. For
observe that poets of the grander and more comprehensive
kind of genius have in them two separate men quite distinct
from each other&mdash;the imaginative man, and the practical,
circumstantial man; and it is the happy mixture of these
that suits diseases of the mind, half imaginative and half
practical.... For hypochondria and satiety what is better
than a brisk alterative course of travels&mdash;especially early,
out-of-the-way, marvellous, legendary travels! How they
freshen up the spirits! How they take you out of the
humdrum yawning state you are in.... Then, for that vice
of the mind which I call sectarianism&mdash;not in the religious
sense of the word, but little, narrow prejudices, that make
you hate your next-door neighbour, because he has his
eggs roasted when you have yours boiled; and gossiping
and prying into people's affairs, and backbiting, and thinking
heaven and earth are coming together, if some broom
touch a cobweb that you have let grow over the window-sill
of your brains&mdash;what like a large and generous, mildly
aperient course of history! How it clears away all the
fumes of the head!&mdash;better than the hellebore with which
the old leeches of the Middle Ages purged the cerebellum.
There, amidst all that great whirl and <i>sturmbad</i> (storm-bath),
as the Germans say, of kingdoms and empires, and
races and ages, how your mind enlarges beyond that little
feverish animosity to John Styles: or that unfortunate
prepossession of yours, that all the world is interested in
your grievances against Tom Stokes and his wife!</p>

<p>I can only touch, you see, on a few ingredients in this
magnificent pharmacy&mdash;its resources are boundless, but
require the nicest discretion. I remember to have cured
a disconsolate widower, who obstinately refused every
other medicament, by a strict course of geology.... I made
no less notable a cure of a young scholar at Cambridge, who
was meant for the Church, when he suddenly caught a cold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
fit of freethinking, with great shiverings, from wading out
of his depth in Spinoza.... His theological constitution,
since then, has become so robust that he has eaten up two
livings and a deanery! In fact, I have a plan for a library
that, instead of heading its compartments, 'Philology,
Natural Science, Poetry,' &amp;c., one shall head them according
to the diseases for which they are severally good, bodily
and mental&mdash;up from a dire calamity, or the pangs of the
gout, down to a fit of the spleen or a slight catarrh; for
which last your light reading comes in with a whey-posset
and barley-water. But when some one sorrow, that is yet
reparable, gets hold of your mind like a monomania&mdash;when
you think, because heaven has denied you this or that, on
which you had set your heart, that all your life must be
a blank&mdash;oh! then diet yourself well on biography&mdash;the
biography of good and great men.... I have said nothing
of the Book of Books, for that is the <i>lignum vitae</i>, the
cardinal medicine for all. These are but the subsidiaries.&mdash;<span class="smcap">E.
G. E. L. Bulwer-Lytton, Lord Lytton.</span> <i>The Caxtons.</i></p>


<h3>A LITERATURA HILARIS</h3>

<p>Cast your eyes down any list of English writers ... and
almost the only names that strike you as belonging to
personally cheerful men are Beaumont and Fletcher,
Suckling, Fielding, Farquhar, Steele, O'Keefe, Andrew
Marvell, and Sterne.... I am only speaking of the rarity
of a certain kind of sunshine in our literature, and expressing
a little rainy-day wish that we had a little more of it. It
ought to be collected. There should be a joyous set of
elegant extracts&mdash;a <i>Literatura Hilaris</i> or <i>Gaudens</i>,&mdash;in
a score of volumes, that we could have at hand, like a
cellaret of good wine, against April or November weather.
Fielding should be the port, and Farquhar the champagne,
and Sterne the malmsey; and whenever the possessor cast
an eye on his stock he should know that he had a choice
draught for himself after a disappointment, or for a friend
after dinner,&mdash;some cordial extract of Parson Adams, or
Plume, or Uncle Toby, generous as heart could desire, and
as wholesome for it as laughter for the lungs.&mdash;<span class="smcap">J. H. Leigh
Hunt.</span> <i>Cheerful Poets.</i></p>

<h3>THE BLESSED CHLOROFORM OF THE MIND</h3>

<p>A congenial book can be taken up by any lover of
books, with the certainty of its transporting the reader
within a few minutes to a region immeasurably removed
from that which he desires to quit. The shape or pattern
of the magic carpet whereon he flies through space and
time, is of no consequence. The son of science is rapt by
a problem; the philosopher by an abstruse speculation;
the antiquary is carried centuries back into the chivalric
past; the lover of poetry is borne upon glittering wings
into the future. The charm works well for all. Books are
the blessed chloroform of the mind.... It is not a very
high claim that is here set forth on behalf of Literature&mdash;that
of Pass-time, and yet what a blessed boon even that
is! Conceive the hours of <i>inertia</i> (a thing different from
idleness) that it has mercifully consumed for us! hours
wherein nothing could be done, nothing, perhaps, be <i>thought</i>,
of our own selves, by reason of some impending calamity.
Wisely does the dentist furnish his hateful antechamber
with books of all sorts. Who could abide for an hour in
such an apartment with nothing to occupy his thoughts
save the expectation of that wrench to come!... Indeed,
it must be confessed that where Books fail as an anodyne,
is rather in cases of physical than of mental pain. Through
the long watches of the night, and by the bedside of some
slowly dying dear one, it is easier to obtain forgetfulness&mdash;the
only kind of rest that it may be safe or possible to take&mdash;by
means of reading, than to do so when one is troubled with
mere toothache. Nor does this arise from selfishness&mdash;since
we would endure twenty toothaches, if they might give ease
to the sufferer&mdash;but because the sharpness of the pang
prevents our applying our mind to anything else; while
the deep dull sorrow of the soul permits an intervening
thought, and over it slides another, and then another, until
a layer of such is formed, and the mind of the reader gets
wholly free, for a brief but blessed time, partitioned off,
as it were, from his real trouble.&mdash;<span class="smcap">J. Payn.</span> <i>Chambers's
Journal</i>, 1864.</p>

<h3>LOUNGING BOOKS</h3>

<p>I sometimes wish for a catalogue of lounging books&mdash;books
that one takes up in the gout, low spirits, <i>ennui</i>, or
when in waiting for company. Some novels, gay poetry,
odd whimsical authors, as Rabelais, &amp;c. A catalogue
raisonné of such might be itself a good lounging book.&mdash;<span class="smcap">H.

<h3>READING IN BED</h3>

<p>Since I cannot in the way of gratefulness express unto
your lordship, as I would, those hearty sentiments I have
of your goodness to me; I will at the last endeavour, in
the way of duty and observance, to let you see how the
little needle of my soul is throughly touched at the great
loadstone of yours, and followeth suddenly and strongly,
which way soever you beckon it. In this occasion, the
magnetic motion was impatient to have the book in my
hands that your lordship gave so advantageous a character
of; whereupon I sent presently (as late as it was) to Paul's
church-yard for this favourite of yours, <i>Religio Medici</i>:
which after awhile found me in a condition fit to receive
a blessing by a visit from any of such masterpieces, as you
look upon with gracious eyes; for I was newly gotten into
my bed. This good-natured creature I could easily persuade
to be my bedfellow, and to wake with me as long as I had
any edge to entertain myself with the delights I sucked
from so noble a conversation. And truly, my lord, I closed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
not my eyes till I had enriched myself with, or at least
exactly surveyed all the treasures that are lapped up in the
folds of those few sheets. To return only a general commendation
of this curious piece, or at large to admire the
author's spirit and smartness, were too perfunctory an
account, and too slight a one, to so discerning and steady an
eye as yours, after so particular and encharged a summons
to read heedfully this discourse. I will therefore presume
to blot a sheet or two of paper with my reflections upon
sundry passages.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Sir K. Digby</span> (Letter to Edward, Earl of
Dorset).</p>


<h3>READING AND MEAL TIMES</h3>

<p>Before my meals,... and after, I let myself loose from
all my thoughts; and now would forget that I ever studied.
A full mind takes away the body's appetite, no less than
a full body makes a dull and unwieldy mind.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Joseph Hall</span>
(Letter to Lord Denny).</p>


<h3>THE DOG AND THE BONE</h3>

<p>At Mr. Dilly's to-day [April 15, 1778] ... before dinner
Dr. Johnson seized upon Mr. Charles Sheridan's <i>Account
of the late Revolution in Sweden</i>, and seemed to read it
ravenously, as if he devoured it, which was to all appearance
his method of studying. 'He knows how to read
better than any one (said Mrs. Knowles); he gets at the
substance of a book directly; he tears out the heart of it.'
He kept it wrapt up in the tablecloth in his lap during the
time of dinner, from an avidity to have one entertainment
in readiness when he should have finished another; resembling
(if I may use so coarse a simile) a dog who holds a bone
in his paws in reserve, while he eats something else which
has been thrown to him.&mdash;<span class="smcap">J. Boswell.</span> <i>Life of Johnson.</i></p>


<h3>PROOF OF GOOD MATTER</h3>

<p>If you find the Miltons in certain parts dirtied and
soiled with a crumb of right Gloucester, blacked in the
candle (my usual supper), or peradventure a stray ash
of tobacco wafted into the crevices, look to that passage
more especially: depend upon it, it contains good matter.&mdash;<span class="smcap">C.
Lamb</span> (Letter to S. T. Coleridge).</p>

<h3>WRITING AT MEAL TIMES</h3>

<p>... Albeit, when I did dictate [these Chronicles], I
thought thereof no more than you, who possibly were
drinking the whilst, as I was. For in the composing of this
lordly book I never lost nor bestowed any more, nor any
other time, than what was appointed to serve me for taking
of my bodily refection, that is, whilst I was eating and
drinking. And, indeed, that is the fittest and most proper
hour, wherein to write these high matters and deep sentences:
as Homer knew very well, the paragon of all
philologues, and Ennius, the father of the Latin poets, as
Horace calls him, although a certain sneaking jobbernol
alleged that his verses smelled more of the wine than oil.&mdash;<span class="smcap">F.
Rabelais.</span> <i>The Life of Gargantua and Pantagruel.

<h3>OUT-OF-DOORS READING</h3>

<p>I am not much a friend to out-of-doors reading. I cannot
settle my spirits to it. I knew a Unitarian minister, who
was generally to be seen upon Snow-hill (as yet Skinner's-street
<i>was not</i>), between the hours of ten and eleven in the
morning, studying a volume of Lardner. I own this to have
been a strain of abstraction beyond my reach. I used to
admire how he sidled along, keeping clear of secular contacts.
An illiterate encounter with a porter's knot, or
a bread basket, would have quickly put to flight all the
theology I am master of, and have left me worse than
indifferent to the five points.&mdash;<span class="smcap">C. Lamb.</span> <i>Detached Thoughts

<h3>THE FIRST AUTHORS FOR YOUTH</h3>

<p>And as it is fit to read the best authors to youth first,
so let them be of the openest and clearest: as Livy before
Sallust, Sidney before Donne; and beware of letting them
taste Gower or Chaucer at first, lest falling too much in love
with antiquity, and not apprehending the weight, they
grow rough and barren in language only. When their
judgements are firm and out of danger, let them read both
the old and the new; but no less take heed that their new
flowers and sweetness do not as much corrupt as the others'
dryness and squalor, if they choose not carefully. Spenser,
in affecting the ancients, writ no language: yet I would
have him read for his matter, but as Virgil read Ennius.
The reading of Homer and Virgil is counselled by Quintilian
as the best way of informing youth and confirming man.
For, besides that the mind is raised with the height and
sublimity of such a verse, it takes spirit from the greatness
of the matter, and is tincted with the best things. Tragic
and lyric poetry is good too; and comic with the best, if
the manners of the reader be once in safety.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ben Jonson.</span>
<i>Timber.</i></p>


<h3>BOOKS AND THE WORLD</h3>

<p>A man who, without a good fund of knowledge and parts,
adopts a Court life, makes the most ridiculous figure
imaginable. He is a machine, little superior to the Court
clock; and, as this points out the hours, he points out the
frivolous employment of them. He is, at most, a comment
upon the clock; and, according to the hours that it strikes,
tells you, now it is levee, now dinner, now supper time, &amp;c.
The end which I propose by your education is, to unite in
you all the knowledge of a scholar, with the manners of
a courtier, and to join, what is seldom joined in any of my
countrymen, Books and the World. They are commonly
twenty years old before they have spoken to anybody above
their Schoolmaster and the Fellows of their college. If
they happen to have learning, it is only Greek and Latin;
but not one word of Modern History or Modern Languages.
Thus prepared, they go abroad, as they call it; but, in
truth, they stay at home all that while; for being very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
awkward, confoundedly ashamed, and not speaking the
languages, they go into no foreign company, at least none
good; but dine and sup with one another only, at the
tavern.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Lord Chesterfield.</span> <i>Letters to his Son.</i></p>


<h3>ADVICE TO MOTHERS</h3>

<p>Mr. B&mdash;&mdash; has just put into my hands Mr. Locke's
<i>Treatise on Education</i>, and he commands me to give him
my thoughts upon it in writing. He has a very high
regard for this author, and tells me that my tenderness
for Billy will make me think some of the first advice given
in it a little harsh, perhaps; but, although he has not
read it through, only having dipped into it here and there,
he believes, from the name of the author, I cannot have
a better directory; and my opinion of it, after I have
well considered it, will inform him, he says, of my own
capacity and prudence, and how far he may rely upon
both in the point of a first education.&mdash;<span class="smcap">S. Richardson.</span>
<i>Pamela.</i></p>


<h3>GETTING A BOY FORWARD</h3>

<p>I am always for getting a boy forward in his learning;
for that is a sure good. I would let him at first read
<i>any</i> English book which happens to engage his attention;
because you have done a great deal when you have brought
him to have entertainment from a book. He'll get better
books afterwards.&mdash;<span class="smcap">S. Johnson.</span> (Boswell's <i>Life</i>.)</p>


<h3>AT LARGE IN THE LIBRARY</h3>

<p>I would put a child into a library (where no unfit books
are) and let him read at his choice. A child should not be
discouraged from reading anything that he takes a liking
to, from a notion that it is above his reach. If that be the
case, the child will soon find it out and desist; if not, he of
course gains the instruction; which is so much the more
likely to come, from the inclination with which he takes up
the study.&mdash;<span class="smcap">S. Johnson.</span> (Boswell's <i>Life</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>


<h3>THE BEST BOOKS THE COMMONEST</h3>

<p>Books are but one inlet of knowledge; and the powers
of the mind, like those of the body, should be left open to
all impressions. I applied too close to my studies, soon
after I was of your age, and hurt myself irreparably by it.
Whatever may be the value of learning, health and good
spirits are of more.... By conversing with the <i>mighty dead</i>,
we imbibe sentiment with knowledge. We become strongly
attached to those who can no longer either hurt or serve
us, except through the influence which they exert over the
mind. We feel the presence of that power which gives
immortality to human thoughts and actions, and catch the
flame of enthusiasm from all ages and nations.... As to the
books you will have to read by choice or for amusement,
the best are the commonest. The names of many of them
are already familiar to you. Read them as you grow up
with all the satisfaction in your power, and make much
of them. It is, perhaps, the greatest pleasure you will have
in life; the one you will think of longest, and repent of
least. If my life had been more full of calamity than it has
been (much more than I hope yours will be), I would live
it over again, my poor little boy, to have read the books
I did in my youth.&mdash;<span class="smcap">W. Hazlitt.</span> <i>On the Conduct of Life;
or Advice to a Schoolboy.</i></p>


<h3>MONTAIGNE'S EARLY READING</h3>

<p>The first taste or feeling I had of books, was of the pleasure
I took in reading the fables of Ovid's <i>Metamorphoses</i>; for,
being but seven or eight years old, I would steal and
sequester myself from all other delights, only to read them:
Forsomuch as the tongue wherein they were written was to
me natural; and it was the easiest book I knew, and by
reason of the matter therein contained most agreeing with
my young age. For of King Arthur, of Lancelot du Lake,
of Amadis, of Huon of Bordeaux, and such idle time-consuming
and wit-besotting trash of books wherein youth
doth commonly amuse itself, I was not so much as acquainted
with their names, and to this day know not their bodies, nor
what they contain, so exact was my discipline. Whereby<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
I became more careless to study my other prescript lessons.
And well did it fall out for my purpose that I had to deal
with a very discreet master, who out of his judgement could
with such dexterity wink at and second my untowardliness,
and such other faults that were in me. For by that means
I read over Virgil's <i>Aeneas</i>, Terence, Plautus, and other
Italian comedies, allured thereunto by the pleasantness of
their several subjects: Had he been so foolishly-severe, or
so severely froward as to cross this course of mine, I think,
verily, I had never brought anything from the college but the
hate and contempt of books, as doth the greatest part of
our nobility. Such was his discretion, and so warily did he
behave himself, that he saw and would not see: he would
foster and increase my longing: suffering me but by stealth
and by snatches to glut myself with those books, holding
ever a gentle hand over me, concerning other regular studies.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Montaigne.</span></p>


<h3>JOHNSON'S EARLY READING</h3>

<p>Sir, in my early years I read very hard. It is a sad
reflection, but a true one, that I knew almost as much at
eighteen as I do now [then aged fifty-four]. My judgement,
to be sure, was not so good; but I had all the facts. I remember
very well, when I was at Oxford, an old gentleman
said to me, 'Young man, ply your book diligently now and
acquire a stock of knowledge; for when years come upon
you, you will find that poring upon books will be but an
irksome task.'&mdash;<span class="smcap">S. Johnson.</span> (Boswell's <i>Life</i>.)</p>


<h3>GIBBON'S EARLY READING</h3>

<p>The perusal of the Roman classics was at once my exercise
and reward. Dr. Middleton's <i>History</i>, which I then appreciated
above its true value, naturally directed me to the
writings of Cicero. The most perfect editions, that of Olivet,
which may adorn the shelves of the rich, that of Ernesti,
which should lie on the table of the learned, were not within
my reach. For the familiar epistles I used the text and
English commentary of Bishop Ross; but my general
edition was that of Verburgius, published at Amsterdam
in two large volumes in folio, with an indifferent choice of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
various notes.... Cicero in Latin, and Xenophon in Greek,
are indeed the two ancients whom I would first propose to
a liberal scholar....</p>

<p>In the infancy of my reason I turned over, as an idle
amusement, the most serious and important treatise: in
its maturity, the most trifling performance could exercise
my taste or judgement; and more than once I have been
led by a novel into a deep and instructive train of thinking.&mdash;<span class="smcap">E.
Gibbon.</span> <i>Autobiography.</i></p>


<h3>A BIRTH OF INTELLECT</h3>

<p>When only eleven years old, with three pence in my
pocket&mdash;my whole fortune&mdash;I perceived, at Richmond, in
a bookseller's window, a little book, marked 'Price Three pence'&mdash;Swift's
<i>Tale of a Tub</i>. Its odd title excited my
curiosity; I bought it in place of my supper. So impatient
was I to examine it, that I got over into a field at the upper
corner of Kew Gardens, and sat down to read, on the shady
side of a haystack. The book was so different from anything
I had read before&mdash;it was something so new to my
mind, that, though I could not at all understand some parts
of it, still it delighted me beyond measure, and produced,
what I have always considered, a sort of birth of intellect.
I read on till it was dark, without any thought of supper or
bed. When I could see no longer, I put it into my pocket,
and fell asleep beside the stack, till the birds awaked me in
the morning; and then I started off, still reading my little
book. I could relish nothing beside; I carried it about
with me wherever I went, till, when about twenty years old,
I lost it in a box that fell overboard in the Bay of Fundy.&mdash;<span class="smcap">W.
Cobbett.</span></p>

<h3>LEIGH HUNT'S EARLY READING</h3>

<p>Cowley says that even when he was 'a very young boy
at school, instead of his running about on holidays, and
playing with his fellows, he was wont to steal from them
and walk into the fields, either alone with a book, or with
some one companion, if he could find one of the same temper'.
When I was at school, I had no fields to run into, or I should
certainly have gone there; and I must own to having
played a great deal; but then I drew my sports as much
as possible out of books, playing at Trojan wars, chivalrous
encounters with coal-staves, and even at religious mysteries.
When I was not at these games I was either reading in
a corner, or walking round the cloisters with a book under
one arm and my friend linked with the other, or with my
thoughts. It has since been my fate to realize all the
romantic notions I had of a friend at that time.&mdash;<span class="smcap">J. H.
Leigh Hunt.</span> <i>My Books.</i></p>


<h3>A KINDLY TIE</h3>

<p>Then, above all, we had Walter Scott, the kindly, the
generous, the pure&mdash;the companion of what countless
delightful hours; the purveyor of how much happiness;
the friend whom we recall as the constant benefactor of our
youth! How well I remember the type and the brownish
paper of the old duodecimo <i>Tales of My Landlord</i>!... Oh!
for a half-holiday, and a quiet corner, and one of those
books again! Those books, and perhaps those eyes with
which we read them; and, it may be, the brains behind
the eyes! It may be the tart was good; but how fresh the
appetite was!... The boy critic loves the story; grown up,
he loves the author who wrote the story. Hence the kindly
tie is established between writer and reader, and lasts pretty
nearly for life.&mdash;<span class="smcap">W. M. Thackeray.</span> <i>Roundabout Papers.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>


<h3>CHARLES DICKENS'S EARLY READING</h3>

<p>My father had left a small collection of books in a little
room upstairs, to which I had access (for it adjoined my
own), and which nobody else in our house ever troubled.
From that blessed little room, Roderick Random, Peregrine
Pickle, Humphrey Clinker, Tom Jones, the Vicar of Wakefield,
Don Quixote, Gil Blas, and Robinson Crusoe, came out,
a glorious host, to keep me company. They kept alive my
fancy, and my hope of something beyond that place and
time,&mdash;they, and the Arabian Nights, and the Tales of the
Genii&mdash;and did me no harm; for whatever harm was in
some of them was not there for me; <i>I</i> knew nothing of it.
It is astonishing to me now, how I found time, in the midst
of my porings and blunderings over heavier themes, to read
those books as I did. It is curious to me how I could ever
have consoled myself under my small troubles (which were
great troubles to me), by impersonating my favourite
characters in them&mdash;as I did&mdash;and by putting Mr. and
Miss Murdstone into all the bad ones&mdash;which I did too. I
have been Tom Jones (a child's Tom Jones, a harmless
creature) for a week together. I have sustained my own
idea of Roderick Random for a month at a stretch, I verily
believe. I had a greedy relish for a few volumes of Voyages
and Travels&mdash;I forget what, now&mdash;that were on those
shelves; and for days and days I can remember to have
gone about my region of our house, armed with the centrepiece
out of an old set of boot-trees&mdash;the perfect realization
of Captain Somebody, of the Royal British Navy, in danger
of being beset by savages, and resolved to sell his life at
a great price. The Captain never lost dignity, from having
his ears boxed with the Latin grammar. I did; but the
Captain was a Captain and a hero, in despite of all the
grammars of all the languages in the world, dead or alive.</p>

<p>This was my only and my constant comfort. When I think
of it, the picture always rises in my mind, of a summer
evening, the boys at play in the churchyard, and I sitting
on my bed, reading as if for life. Every barn in the neighbourhood,
every stone in the church, and every foot of the
churchyard, had some association of its own, in my mind,
connected with these books, and stood for some locality
made famous in them.&mdash;<span class="smcap">C. Dickens.</span> <i>David Copperfield.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span></p>


<h3>THE VISIONARY GLEAM</h3>

<p>Books have in a great measure lost their power over me;
nor can I revive the same interest in them as formerly.
I perceive when a thing is good, rather than feel it. It is
true,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">'Marcian Colonna' is a dainty book;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>and the reading of Mr. Keats's <i>Eve of St. Agnes</i> lately made
me regret that I was not young again. The beautiful and
tender images there conjured up, 'come like shadows&mdash;so
depart.' The 'tiger-moth's wings', which he has spread
over his rich poetic blazonry, just flit across my fancy;
the gorgeous twilight window which he has painted over
again in his verse, to me 'blushes' almost in vain 'with
blood of queens and kings'. I know how I should have
felt at one time in reading such passages; and that is all.
The sharp luscious flavour, the fine <i>aroma</i> is fled, and
nothing but the stalk, the bran, the husk of literature is
left.&mdash;<span class="smcap">W. Hazlitt.</span> <i>On Reading Old Books.</i></p>

<span class="i2">This rolling world, and view it as it is;<br /></span>

much given to his study and self-society, 'specially to converse

in excess is naught. Now, sir, were I worthy to give you

<h3>WOMAN AND BOOKS</h3>

<p>Hear them [books] speak for themselves.... 'We are
expelled with heart and hand from the domiciles of the
clergy, apportioned to us by hereditary right, in some
interior chamber of which we had our peaceful cells: but,
to their shame, in these nefarious times we are altogether
banished to suffer opprobrium out of doors; our places,
moreover, are occupied by hounds and hawks, and sometimes
by a biped beast; woman to wit,&mdash;whose cohabitation
was formerly shunned by the clergy, from whom we
have ever taught our pupils to fly, more than from the asp
and the basilisk; wherefore this beast, ever jealous of our
studies, and at all times implacable, spying us at last in
a corner, protected only by the web of some long-deceased
spider, drawing her forehead into wrinkles, laughs us to
scorn, abuses us in virulent speeches, points us out as the
only superfluous furniture lodged in the whole house;
complains that we are useless for any purpose of domestic
economy whatever, and recommends our being bartered
away forthwith for costly head-dresses, cambric, silk,
twice-dipped purple garments, woollen, linen, and furs.'&mdash;<span class="smcap">R.
de Bury.</span> <i>Philobiblon.</i></p>


<h3>THE GHOST OF BETTY BARNES</h3>

<p>I beheld a female form, with mob-cap, bib, and apron,
sleeves tucked up to the elbow, a dredging-box in the one
hand, and in the other a sauce-ladle. I concluded, of
course, that it was my friend's cook-maid walking in her
sleep; and as I knew he had a value for Sally, who could
toss a pancake with any girl in the country, I got up to
conduct her safely to the door. But as I approached her,
she said,&mdash;'Hold, sir! I am not what you take me for;'&mdash;words
which seemed so apposite to the circumstances that
I should not have much minded them, had it not been for
the peculiarly hollow sound in which they were uttered.
'Know, then,' she said, in the same unearthly accents,
'that I am the spirit of Betty Barnes.'&mdash;'Who hanged
herself for love of the stage-coachman,' thought I; 'this
is a very proper spot of work!'&mdash;'Of that unhappy Elizabeth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
or Betty Barnes, long cook-maid to Mr. Warburton, the
painful collector, but ah! the too careless custodier, of
the largest collection of ancient plays ever known&mdash;of most
of which the titles only are left to gladden the Prolegomena
of the Variorum Shakespeare. Yes, stranger, it was these
ill-fated hands that consigned to grease and conflagration
the scores of small quartos, which, did they now exist,
would drive the whole Roxburghe Club out of their senses&mdash;it
was these unhappy pickers and stealers that singed fat
fowls and wiped dirty trenchers with the lost works of Beaumont
and Fletcher, Massinger, Jonson, Webster&mdash;what
shall I say?&mdash;even of Shakespeare himself!'&mdash;<span class="smcap">Sir W. Scott.</span>
<i>Introductory Epistle to The Fortunes of Nigel.</i></p>


<h3>A CHEAP AND LASTING PLEASURE</h3>

<p>I yet retain, and carefully cherish, my love of reading.
If relays of eyes were to be hired like post-horses, I would
never admit any but silent companions: they afford
a constant variety of entertainment, which is almost the
only one pleasing in the enjoyment, and inoffensive in the
consequence.... Every woman endeavours to breed her
daughter a fine lady, qualifying her for a station in which
she never will appear: and at the same time incapacitating
her for that retirement to which she is destined. Learning,
if she has a real taste for it, will not only make her contented,
but happy in it. No entertainment is so cheap as
reading, nor any pleasure so lasting. She will not want new
fashions, nor regret the loss of expensive diversions, or
variety of company, if she can be amused with an author
in her closet.... Daughter! daughter! don't call names;
you are always abusing my pleasures, which is what no
mortal will bear. Trash, lumber, sad stuff, are the titles
you give to my favourite amusement. If I called a white
staff a stick of wood, a gold key gilded brass, and the ensigns
of illustrious orders coloured strings, this may be philosophically
true, but would be very ill received. We have all
our playthings; happy are they that can be contented with
those they can obtain: those hours are spent in the wisest
manner that can easiest shade the ills of life, and are
least productive of ill consequences. I think my time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
better employed in reading the adventures of imaginary
people, than the Duchess of Marlborough's, who passed the
latter years of her life in paddling with her will, and contriving
schemes of plaguing some, and extracting praise
from others to no purpose; eternally disappointed and
eternally fretting. The active scenes are over at my age.
I indulge, with all the art I can, my taste for reading.
If I would confine it to valuable books, they are almost as
rare as valuable men. I must be content with what I can
find. As I approach a second childhood, I endeavour to
enter into the pleasures of it. Your youngest son is, perhaps,
at this very moment riding on a poker with great delight,
not at all regretting that it is not a gold one, and much less
wishing it an Arabian horse, which he would not know how
to manage; I am reading an idle tale, not expecting wit
or truth in it, and am very glad it is not metaphysics to
puzzle my judgement, or history to mislead my opinion:
he fortifies his health by exercise; I calm my cares by
oblivion. The methods may appear low to busy people;
but if he improves his strength, and I forget my infirmities,
we both attain very desirable ends.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Lady Mary Wortley

<h3>THE CLASSICAL EDUCATION OF WOMEN</h3>

<p>We have often heard men who wish, as almost all men
of sense wish, that women should be highly educated,
speak with rapture of the English ladies of the sixteenth
century, and lament that they can find no modern damsel
resembling those fair pupils of Ascham and Aylmer who
compared, over their embroidery, the styles of Isocrates
and Lysias, and who, while the horns were sounding and
the dogs in full cry, sat in the lonely oriel, with eyes riveted
to that immortal page which tells how meekly and bravely
the first great martyr of intellectual liberty took the cup
from his weeping gaoler. But surely these complaints have
very little foundation. We would by no means disparage
the ladies of the sixteenth century or their pursuits. But
we conceive that those who extol them at the expense of the
women of our time forget one very obvious and very
important circumstance. In the time of Henry the Eighth
and Edward the Sixth, a person who did not read Greek and
Latin could read nothing, or next to nothing. The Italian
was the only modern language which possessed anything
that could be called a literature. All the valuable books
then extant in all the vernacular dialects of Europe would
hardly have filled a single shelf. England did not yet possess
Shakespeare's plays and the <i>Faery Queene</i>, nor France
Montaigne's <i>Essays</i>, nor Spain <i>Don Quixote</i>. In looking
round a well-furnished library, how many English or French
books can we find which were extant when Lady Jane Grey
and Queen Elizabeth received their education? Chaucer,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
Gower, Froissart, Comines, Rabelais, nearly complete the
list. It was therefore absolutely necessary that a woman
should be uneducated or classically educated.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Lord
Macaulay.</span> <i>Lord Bacon.</i></p>


<h3>GIRLS' READING</h3>

<p>Whether novels, or poetry, or history be read, they
should be chosen, not for what is <i>out</i> of them, but for what
is <i>in</i> them. The chance and scattered evil that may here
and there haunt, or hide itself in, a powerful book, never
does any harm to a noble girl; but the emptiness of an
author oppresses her, and his amiable folly degrades her.
And if she can have access to a good library of old and
classical books, there need be no choosing at all. Keep
the modern magazine and novel out of your girl's way:
turn her loose into the old library every wet day, and let
her alone. She will find what is good for her; you cannot:
for there is just this difference between the making of a girl's
character and a boy's&mdash;you may chisel a boy into shape, as
you would a rock, or hammer him into it, if he be of a better
kind, as you would a piece of bronze. But you cannot
hammer a girl into anything. She grows as a flower does,&mdash;she
will wither without sun; she will decay in her sheath,
as the narcissus does, if you do not give her air enough;
she may fall, and defile her head in dust, if you leave her
without help at some moments of her life; but you cannot
fetter her; she must take her own fair form and way, if she
take any, and in mind as in body, must have always</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">Her household motions light and free<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And steps of virgin liberty.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Let her loose in the library, I say, as you do a fawn in
a field. It knows the bad weeds twenty times better than
you; and the good ones too, and will eat some bitter and
prickly ones, good for it, which you had not the slightest
thought were good.&mdash;<span class="smcap">J. Ruskin.</span><i>Sesame and Lilies.</i><br /><br /></p>

<h3>POETRY AND PIETY</h3>

<p>Flavia buys all books of wit and humour, and has made
an expensive collection of all our English poets. For, she
says, one cannot have a true taste of any of them without
being very conversant with them all.</p>

<p>She will sometimes read a book of piety, if it is a short
one, if it is much commended for style and language, and
she can tell where to borrow it.&mdash;<span class="smcap">W. Law.</span> <i>A serious Call

<h3>A LADY'S LIBRARY</h3>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i9">Non illa colo calathisve Minervae<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Foemineas assueta manus.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Virg.</span><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Some months ago, my friend Sir Roger, being in the
country, enclosed a letter to me, directed to a certain lady
whom I shall here call by the name of Leonora, and as it
contained matters of consequence, desired me to deliver it
to her with my own hand. Accordingly I waited upon her
ladyship pretty early in the morning, and was desired by
her woman to walk into her lady's library, till such time
as she was in readiness to receive me. The very sound of
a lady's library gave me a great curiosity to see it; and,
as it was some time before the lady came to me, I had an
opportunity of turning over a great many of her books,
which were ranged together in a very beautiful order. At
the end of the folios (which were finely bound and gilt) were
great jars of china placed one above another in a very noble
piece of architecture. The quartos were separated from
the octavos by a pile of smaller vessels, which rose in
a delightful pyramid. The octavos were bounded by tea-dishes
of all shapes, colours, and sizes, which were so
disposed on a wooden frame, that they looked like one
continued pillar indented with the finest strokes of sculpture,
and stained with the greatest variety of dyes. That
part of the library which was designed for the reception
of plays and pamphlets, and other loose papers, was enclosed
in a kind of square, consisting of one of the prettiest
grotesque works that I ever saw, and made up of scaramouches,
lions, monkeys, mandarins, trees, shells, and a
thousand other odd figures in china ware. In the midst<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
of the room was a little japan table, with a quire of gilt
paper upon it, and upon the paper a silver snuff-box made
in the shape of a little book. I found there were several
other counterfeit books upon the upper shelves, which were
carved in wood, and served only to fill up the number, like
faggots in the muster of a regiment. I was wonderfully
pleased with such a mixed kind of furniture as seemed very
suitable both to the lady and the scholar, and did not know
at first whether I should fancy myself in a grotto or in
a library.</p>

<p>Upon my looking into the books I found there were some
few which the lady had bought for her own use, but that
most of them had been got together, either because she had
heard them praised, or because she had seen the authors of
them. Among several that I examined, I very well remember
these that follow:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Ogilby's <i>Virgil</i>. Dryden's <i>Juvenal</i>. <i>Cassandra.</i> <i>Cleopatra.</i> <i>Astraea.</i>
Sir Isaac Newton's works. <i>The Grand Cyrus</i>, with a pin stuck in one
of the middle leaves. Pembroke's <i>Arcadia</i>. Locke of <i>Human Understanding</i>;
with a paper of patches in it. A spelling-book. A dictionary
for the explanation of hard words. Sherlock upon Death. <i>The Fifteen
Comforts of Matrimony.</i> Sir William Temple's Essays. Father Malebranche's
<i>Search after Truth</i>, translated into English. A book of Novels.
<i>The Academy of Compliments.</i> Culpepper's <i>Midwifery</i>. <i>The Ladies'
Calling.</i> Tales in Verse by Dr. D'Urfey: bound in red leather, gilt on
the back, and doubled down in several places. All the Classic authors,
in wood. A set of Elzevirs by the same hand. <i>Clelia</i>: which opened
of itself in the place that describes two lovers in a bower. Baker's
<i>Chronicle</i>. <i>Advice to a Daughter.</i> <i>The New Atlantis</i>, with a key to it.
Mr. Steele's <i>Christian Hero</i>. A Prayer-book: with a bottle of Hungary
water by the side of it. Dr. Sacheverell's Speech. Fielding's Trial.
Seneca's <i>Morals</i>. Taylor's <i>Holy Living and Dying</i>. La Ferte's <i>Instructions
for Country-dances</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p>I was taking a catalogue in my pocket-book of these and
several other authors, when Leonora entered.&mdash;<span class="smcap">J. Addison.</span>

<h3>WOMEN'S WANT</h3>

<p>Except some professed scholars, I have often observed
that women in general read much more than men; but, for
want of a plan, a method, a fixed object, their reading is of
little benefit to themselves, or others.&mdash;<span class="smcap">E. Gibbon.</span> <i>Autobiography.</i></p>

<h3>BOOKS FOR A LADY'S LIBRARY</h3>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i3">Convivae prope dissentire videntur,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Poscentes vario multum diversa palato.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Quid dem? quid non dem?<br /></span>

<span class="i20"><span class="smcap">Hor.</span><br /></span>
</div></div>


<p>Since I have called out for help in my catalogue of
a lady's library, I have received many letters upon that
head, some of which I shall give an account of. In the
first class I shall take notice of those which come to me
from eminent booksellers, who every one of them mention
with respect the authors they have printed, and consequently
have an eye to their own advantage more than to that
of the ladies. One tells me, that he thinks it absolutely
necessary for women to have true notions of right and
equity, and that therefore they cannot peruse a better book
than Dalton's <i>Country Justice</i>: another thinks they cannot
be without <i>The Compleat Jockey</i>. A third, observing the
curiosity and desire of prying into secrets, which he tells
me is natural to the fair sex, is of opinion this female
inclination, if well directed, might turn very much to their
advantage, and therefore recommends to me <i>Mr. Mede upon
the Revelations</i>. A fourth lays it down as an unquestioned
truth, that a lady cannot be thoroughly accomplished who
has not read the <i>Secret Treaties and Negotiations of Marshal
d'Estrades</i>. Mr. Jacob Tonson, junior, is of opinion, that
<i>Bayle's Dictionary</i> might be of very great use to the ladies,
in order to make them general scholars. Another, whose
name I have forgotten, thinks it highly proper that every
woman with child should read Mr. Wall's <i>History of Infant
Baptism</i>: as another is very importunate with me to
recommend to all my female readers <i>The Finishing Stroke:
Being a Vindication of the Patriarchal Scheme</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p>In the second class I shall mention books which are
recommended by husbands, if I may believe the writers of
them. Whether or no they are real husbands or personated
ones I cannot tell, but the books they recommend are as
follow. <i>A Paraphrase on the History of Susanna.</i> <i>Rules
to keep Lent.</i> <i>The Christian's Overthrow prevented.</i> <i>A Dissuasive
from the Playhouse.</i> <i>The Virtues of Camphire, with
Directions to make Camphire Tea.</i> <i>The pleasures of a Country<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
Life.</i> <i>The Government of the Tongue.</i> A letter dated from
Cheapside desires me that I would advise all young wives
to make themselves mistresses of Wingate's <i>Arithmetic</i>,
and concludes with a postscript, that he hopes I will not
forget <i>The Countess of Kent's Receipts</i>.</p>

<p>I may reckon the ladies themselves as a third class
among these my correspondents and privy-councillors. In
a letter from one of them, I am advised to place <i>Pharamond</i>
at the head of my catalogue, and, if I think proper, to
give the second place to <i>Cassandra</i>. Coquetilla begs me not
to think of nailing women upon their knees with manuals
of devotion, nor of scorching their faces with books of
housewifery. Florella desires to know if there are any books
written against prudes, and entreats me, if there are, to
give them a place in my library. Plays of all sorts have
their several advocates: <i>All for Love</i> is mentioned in above
fifteen letters; <i>Sophonisba</i>, or <i>Hannibal's Overthrow</i>, in
a dozen; <i>The Innocent Adultery</i> is likewise highly approved
of; <i>Mithridates, King of Pontus</i> has many friends; <i>Alexander
the Great</i> and <i>Aurengzebe</i> have the same number of
voices; but <i>Theodosius</i>, or <i>The Force of Love</i>, carries it
from all the rest.&mdash;<span class="smcap">J. Addison.</span> <i>Spectator</i>, 92.</p>

<h3>LETTER-FERRETS</h3>

<p>Dionysius scoffeth at those grammarians who ploddingly
labour to know the miseries of Ulysses, and are ignorant of
their own.... Except our mind be the better, unless our
judgement be the sounder, I had rather my scholar had
employed his time in playing at tennis; I am sure his
body would be the nimbler. See but one of these our
university men or bookish scholars return from school, after
he hath there spent ten or twelve years under a pedant's
charge: who is so inapt for any matter? who so unfit for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
any company? who so to seek if he come into the world?
all the advantage you discover in him is that his Latin and
Greek have made him more sottish, more stupid, and more
presumptuous, than before he went from home.... My
vulgar Perigordian speech doth very pleasantly term such
self-conceited wizards, letter-ferrets, as if they would say
letter-stricken men, to whom (as the common saying is)
letters have given a blow with a mallet.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Montaigne.</span></p>


<h3>DAINTIES THAT ARE BRED OF A BOOK</h3>

<p>Sir, he hath not fed of the dainties that are bred of a
book; he hath not eat paper, as it were; he hath not
drunk ink: his intellect is not replenished; he is only an
animal, only sensible in the duller parts.&mdash;<span class="smcap">W. Shakespeare.</span>
<i>Love's Labour's Lost.</i></p>


<h3>AN ANTIQUARY</h3>

<p>He loves no library, but where there are more spiders'
volumes than authors', and looks with great admiration on
the antique work of cobwebs. Printed books he contemns,
as a novelty of this latter age; but a manuscript he pores
on everlastingly, especially if the cover be all moth-eaten,
and the dust make a parenthesis between every syllable.
He would give all the books in his study (which are rarities
all) for one of the old Roman binding, or six lines of Tully
in his own hand.&mdash;<span class="smcap">J. Earle.</span> <i>Microcosmographie.</i></p>

<h3>BIBLIOSOPHIA</h3>

<p>I will begin, by designating the high and dignified
passion in question by its true name&mdash;BIBLIOSOPHIA,&mdash;which
I would define&mdash;<i>an appetite for</i> <span class="smcap">COLLECTING</span> <i>Books</i>&mdash;carefully
distinguished from, wholly unconnected with, nay,
absolutely repugnant to, all idea of <span class="smcap">READING</span> them.</p>

<p>Observe, then, with merited admiration, the several points
of superiority, which distinguish the <i>Collector</i>, when brought
into fair and close comparison with the <i>Student</i>. As</p>

<p>First; the said <i>Collector</i> proceeds straight forward to his
object, and (with one only exception which will hereafter
be shown) under the most rational hopes of accomplishing
it. There is but a certain, and limited, number of books
to which he and his inquisitive fraternity have agreed to
consecrate the epithet 'curious'; and all of these&mdash;with
the requisite allowance of cash, cunning, luck, patience,
and time&mdash;he is within the 'potentiality' of drawing,
sooner or later, within his clutches:&mdash;whereas the <i>Student</i>,
granting him the wealth of a brewer, the cunning of a horse-dealer,
the luck of a fool, the patience of Jerry Sneak, and
the longevity of the Wandering Jew, can never hope even
to <i>taste</i> an hundredth part of the volumes which he meditates
to devour.</p>

<p>In the next place, the treasures of the <i>Collector</i>, when once
he has submitted to the pleasing toil of procuring them,
are his own;&mdash;his own, I mean, in the single sense in which
he is desirous so to call them; for he leaves them in the safe
custody of his shelves, until the arrival of that proud<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
moment, when he shall be dared by an envious rival, to
prove that the title-page of some forgotten (and thence
remembered) volume, is perfect&mdash;or properly imperfect; or
that it enjoys the reputation of having been printed, long
before the Art had approached towards any tolerable degree
of improvement; or, that it possesses some one, or more, of
those curious advantages, upon which a fitter occasion for
expatiating will present itself by and by:&mdash;and now, how
stands the point of <i>possession</i>, with the <i>Student</i>?&mdash;unprosperously
indeed!&mdash;for besides that, as already observed,
he can never possibly possess, in <i>his</i> sense of that expression,
more than a wretched modicum of his coveted treasures, he
is doomed to a very precarious property even in those
which he may have actually hoarded; inasmuch as they
are entrusted to the care of that most treacherous of all
librarians, <i>Memory</i>,&mdash;which, at all times, and of necessity,
treats the Student's collections, as the professed Collector,
occasionally, and by choice only, is tempted to treat <i>his</i>,&mdash;by
casting out a great part of them for want of room....
'Let us now be told no more,' of the superiority of the
<i>Student</i> over the <i>Collector</i>.&mdash;<span class="smcap">J. Beresford.</span> <i>Bibliosophia.</i></p>


<h3>GOLDEN VOLUMES! RICHEST TREASURES!</h3>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">Golden volumes! richest treasures!<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Objects of delicious pleasures!<br /></span>
<span class="i1">You my eyes rejoicing please,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">You my hands in rapture seize!<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Brilliant wits and moving sages,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Lights who beamed through many ages,<br /></span>

<span class="i1">And now their hope of fame achieved,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Dear volumes!&mdash;you have not deceived!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This passion for the acquisition and enjoyment of <i>books</i>
has been the occasion of their lovers embellishing their
outsides with costly ornaments: a rage which ostentation
may have abused; but when these volumes belong to the
real man of letters, the most fanciful bindings are often the
emblems of his taste and feelings. The great Thuanus was
eager to procure the finest copies for his library, and his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
volumes are still eagerly purchased, bearing his autograph
on the last page. A celebrated amateur was Grollier, whose
library was opulent in these luxuries; the Muses themselves
could not more ingeniously have ornamented their favourite
works. I have seen several in the libraries of our own
curious collectors. He embellished their outside with taste
and ingenuity. They are gilded and stamped with peculiar
neatness, the compartments on the binding are drawn, and
painted, with different inventions of subjects, analogous to
the works themselves; and they are further adorned by
that amiable inscription, <i>Jo. Grollierii et amicorum</i>!&mdash;purporting
that these literary treasures were collected for
himself and for his friends.&mdash;<span class="smcap">I. d'Israeli.</span> <i>Curiosities of
Literature: Libraries.</i></p>


<h3>A MALADY OF WEAK MINDS</h3>

<p>The Bibliomania, or the collecting an enormous heap of
books without intelligent curiosity, has, since libraries have
existed, infected weak minds, who imagine that they themselves
acquire knowledge when they keep it on their shelves.
Their motley libraries have been called the <i>madhouses of
the human mind</i>; and again, the <i>tomb of books</i>, when the
possessor will not communicate them, and coffins them
up in the cases of his library&mdash;and as it was facetiously
observed, these collections are not without a <i>Lock on
the Human Understanding</i>.&mdash;<span class="smcap">I. d'Israeli.</span> <i>Curiosities of
Literature: The Bibliomania.</i></p>


<h3>AN UNWORTHY PROFESSOR</h3>

<p>'I will frankly confess,' rejoined Lysander, 'that I am
an arrant bibliomaniac&mdash;that I love books dearly&mdash;that the
very sight, touch, and mere perusal&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Hold, my friend,' again exclaimed Philemon; 'you have
renounced your profession&mdash;you talk of <i>reading</i> books&mdash;do
bibliomaniacs ever <i>read</i> books?'&mdash;<span class="smcap">T. F. Dibdin.</span> <i>Bibliomania.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span></p>


<h3>A BIBLIOMANIAC</h3>

<p>You observe, my friends, said I, softly, yonder active
and keen-visaged gentleman? 'Tis Lepidus. Like Magliabechi,
content with frugal fare and frugal clothing and preferring
the riches of a library to those of house-furniture,
he is insatiable in his bibliomaniacal appetites. 'Long
experience has made him sage:' and it is not therefore
without just reason that his opinions are courted and
considered as almost oracular. You will find that he will
take his old station, commanding the right or left wing of
the auctioneer; and that he will enliven, by the gaiety and
shrewdness of his remarks, the circle that more immediately
surrounds him. Some there are who will not bid till Lepidus
bids; and who surrender all discretion and opinion of their
own to his universal book-knowledge. The consequence is
that Lepidus can, with difficulty, make purchases for his
own library, and a thousand dexterous and happy manoeuvres
are of necessity obliged to be practised by him, whenever
a rare or curious book turns up.... Justly respectable as are
his scholarship and good sense, he is not what you may call
a <i>fashionable</i> collector; for old chronicles and romances are
most rigidly discarded from his library. Talk to him of
Hoffman, Schoettgenius, Rosenmuller, and Michaelis, and
he will listen courteously to your conversation; but when
you expatiate, however learnedly and rapturously, upon
Froissart and Prince Arthur, he will tell you that he has
a heart of stone upon the subject; and that even a clean
uncut copy of an original impression of each, by Verard or
by Caxton, would not bring a single tear of sympathetic
transport to his eyes.&mdash;<span class="smcap">T. F. Dibdin.</span> <i>Bibliomania.</i></p>


<h3>THE ENVIABLE BOOKWORM</h3>

<p>The character of a scholar not unfrequently dwindles
down into the shadow of a shade, till nothing is left of it
but the mere bookworm. There is often something amiable
as well as enviable in this last character. I know one such
instance, at least. The person I mean has an admiration
for learning, if he is only dazzled by its light. He lives
among old authors, if he does not enter much into their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
spirit. He handles the covers, and turns over the page,
and is familiar with the names and dates. He is busy and
self-involved. He hangs like a film and cobweb upon
letters, or is like the dust upon the outside of knowledge,
which should not be rudely brushed aside. He follows
learning as its shadow; but as such, he is respectable. He
browses on the husk and leaves of books, as the young fawn
browses on the bark and leaves of trees. Such a one lives
all his life in a dream of learning, and has never once had
his sleep broken by a real sense of things. He believes implicitly
in genius, truth, virtue, liberty, because he finds
the names of these things in books. He thinks that love
and friendship are the finest things imaginable, both in
practice and theory. The legend of good women is to him
no fiction. When he steals from the twilight of his cell,
the scene breaks upon him like an illuminated missal, and
all the people he sees are but so many figures in a <i>camera
obscura</i>. He reads the world, like a favourite volume, only
to find beauties in it, or like an edition of some old work
which he is preparing for the press, only to make emendations
in it, and correct the errors that have inadvertently
slipt in. He and his dog Tray are much the same honest,
simple-hearted, faithful, affectionate creatures&mdash;if Tray
could but read! His mind cannot take the impression of
vice: but the gentleness of his nature turns gall to milk.
He would not hurt a fly. He draws the picture of mankind
from the guileless simplicity of his own heart: and
when he dies, his spirit will take its smiling leave, without
having ever had an ill thought of others, or the consciousness
of one in itself.&mdash;<span class="smcap">W. Hazlitt.</span> <i>On the Conversation
of Authors.</i></p>


<h3>EARS NAILED TO BOOKS</h3>

<p>A mere scholar, who knows nothing but books, must be
ignorant even of them. 'Books do not teach the use of
books.' How should he know anything of a work who
knows nothing of the subject of it? The learned pedant
is conversant with books only as they are made of other
books, and those again of others, without end. He parrots
those who have parroted others. He can translate the same
word into ten different languages, but he knows nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
of the <i>thing</i> which it means in any one of them. He stuffs
his head with authorities built on authorities, with quotations
quoted from quotations, while he locks up his senses,
his understanding, and his heart. He is unacquainted with
the maxims and manners of the world; he is to seek in
the characters of individuals. He sees no beauty in the
face of nature or of art. To him 'the mighty world of
eye and ear' is hid; and 'knowledge', except at one
entrance, 'quite shut out.' His pride takes part with his
ignorance; and his self-importance rises with the number
of things of which he does not know the value, and which
he therefore despises as unworthy of his notice. He knows
nothing of pictures,&mdash;'of the colouring of Titian, the grace
of Raphael, the purity of Domenichino, the <i>corregioscity</i> of
Correggio, the learning of Poussin, the airs of Guido, the
taste of the Caracci, or the grand contour of Michael
Angelo',&mdash;of all those glories of the Italian and miracles
of the Flemish school, which have filled the eyes of mankind
with delight, and to the study and imitation of which
thousands have in vain devoted their lives. These are to
him as if they had never been, a mere dead letter, a byword;
and no wonder, for he neither sees nor understands
their prototypes in nature. A print of Rubens' Watering-place,
or Claude's Enchanted Castle may be hanging on
the walls of his room for months without his once perceiving
them; and if you point them out to him he will
turn away from them. The language of nature, or of art
(which is another nature), is one that he does not understand.
He repeats indeed the names of Apelles and Phidias, because
they are to be found in classic authors, and boasts of their
works as prodigies, because they no longer exist; or when
he sees the finest remains of Grecian art actually before him
in the Elgin Marbles, takes no other interest in them than
as they lead to a learned dispute, and (which is the same
thing) a quarrel about the meaning of a Greek particle.
He is equally ignorant of music; he 'knows no touch of
it,' from the strains of the all-accomplished Mozart to the
shepherd's pipe upon the mountain. His ears are nailed
to his books; and deadened with the sound of the Greek
and Latin tongues, and the din and smithery of school-learning.&mdash;<span class="smcap">W.
Hazlitt.</span> <i>On the Ignorance of the Learned.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span></p>


<h3>THE ANTIQUARY'S TREASURES</h3>

<p>The collection was indeed a curious one, and might well
be envied by an amateur. Yet it was not collected at the
enormous prices of modern times, which are sufficient to
have appalled the most determined as well as earliest
bibliomaniac upon record, whom we take to have been none
else than the renowned Don Quixote de la Mancha, as,
among other slight indications of an infirm understanding,
he is stated, by his veracious historian, Cid Hamet Benengeli,
to have exchanged fields and farms for folios and
quartos of chivalry.... Mr. Oldbuck did not follow these
collectors in such excess of expenditure; but, taking
a pleasure in the personal labour of forming his library,
saved his purse at the expense of his time and toil.... 'Davy
Wilson,' he said, 'commonly called Snuffy Davy, from his
inveterate addiction to black rappee, was the very prince of
scouts for searching blind alleys, cellars, and stalls, for rare
volumes. He had the scent of a slow-hound, sir, and the
snap of a bull-dog. He would detect you an old black-letter
ballad among the leaves of a law-paper, and find an <i>editio
princeps</i> under the mask of a school Corderius.' ... 'Even I,
sir,' he went on, 'though far inferior in industry and discernment
and presence of mind to that great man, can
show you a few&mdash;a very few things, which I have collected,
not by force of money, as any wealthy man might,&mdash;although,
as my friend Lucian says, he might chance to throw away
his coin only to illustrate his ignorance,&mdash;but gained in
a manner that shows I know something of the matter. See
this bundle of ballads, not one of them later than 1700, and
some of them a hundred years older. I wheedled an old
woman out of these, who loved them better than her psalm-book.
Tobacco, sir, snuff, and the <i>Complete Syren</i>, were
the equivalent! For that mutilated copy of the <i>Complaynt
of Scotland</i>, I sat out the drinking of two dozen bottles of
strong ale with the late learned proprietor, who, in gratitude,
bequeathed it to me by his last will. These little Elzevirs
are the memoranda and trophies of many a walk by night
and morning through the Cowgate, the Canongate, the Bow,
Saint Mary's Wynd,&mdash;wherever, in fine, there were to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
found brokers and traders, those miscellaneous dealers in
things rare and curious. How often have I stood haggling
on a halfpenny, lest, by a too ready acquiescence in the
dealer's first price, he should be led to suspect, the value
I set upon the article!&mdash;how have I trembled, lest some
passing stranger should chop in between me and the prize,
and regarded each poor student of divinity that stopped to
turn over the books at the stall, as a rival amateur, or
prowling bookseller in disguise!&mdash;And then, Mr. Lovel, the
sly satisfaction with which one pays the consideration, and
pockets the article, affecting a cold indifference, while the
hand is trembling with pleasure!&mdash;Then to dazzle the eyes
of our wealthier and emulous rivals by showing them such
a treasure as this' (displaying a little black smoked book
about the size of a primer); 'to enjoy their surprise and
envy, shrouding meanwhile, under a veil of mysterious consciousness,
our own superior knowledge and dexterity;&mdash;these,
my young friend, these are the white moments of
life, that repay the toil, and pains, and sedulous attention,
which our profession, above all others, so peculiarly
demands!' ...</p>

<p>Here were editions esteemed as being the first, and there
stood those scarcely less regarded as being the last and best;
here was a book valued because it had the author's final
improvements, and there another which (strange to tell!)
was in request because it had them not. One was precious
because it was a folio, another because it was a duodecimo;
some because they were tall, some because they were short;
the merit of this lay in the title-page&mdash;of that in the arrangement
of the letters in the word Finis. There was, it seemed,
no peculiar distinction, however trifling or minute, which
might not give value to a volume, providing the indispensable
quality of scarcity, or rare occurrence, was attached
to it.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Sir W. Scott.</span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span> <i>The Antiquary.</i></p>


<p>I would rather be a poor man in a garret with plenty
of books than a king who did not love reading.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Lord
Macaulay.</span></p>


<h3>KISSING A FOLIO</h3>

<p>Sitting, last winter, among my books, and walled round
with all the comfort and protection which they and my
fireside could afford me; to wit, a table of high-piled books
at my back, my writing-desk on one side of me, some shelves
on the other, and the feeling of the warm fire at my feet;
I began to consider how I loved the authors of those books:
how I loved them, too, not only for the imaginative pleasures
they afforded me, but for their making me love the very
books themselves, and delight to be in contact with them.
I looked sideways at my Spenser, my Theocritus, and my
<i>Arabian Nights</i>; then above them at my Italian poets;
then behind me at my Dryden and Pope, my romances, and
my Boccaccio; then on my left side at my Chaucer, who
lay on a writing-desk; and thought how natural it was in
C[harles] L[amb] to give a kiss to an old folio, as I once
saw him do to Chapman's <i>Homer</i>.... I entrench myself
in my books equally against sorrow and the weather. If
the wind comes through a passage I look about to see how
I can fence it off by a better disposition of my movables;
if a melancholy thought is importunate, I give another
glance at my Spenser. When I speak of being in contact
with my books, I mean it literally. I like to lean my head
against them.&mdash;<span class="smcap">J. H. Leigh Hunt.</span> <i>My Books.</i></p>


<h3>THE LITERARY HAREM</h3>

<p>I must have my literary <i>harem</i>, my <i>parc aux cerfs</i>, where
my favourites await my moments of leisure and pleasure,&mdash;my
scarce and precious editions, my luxurious typographical
masterpieces; my Delilahs, that take my head in their lap;
the pleasant story-tellers and the like; the books I love
because they are fair to look upon, prized by collectors,
endeared by old associations, secret treasures that nobody
else knows anything about; books, in short, that I like for
insufficient reasons it may be, but peremptorily, and mean
to like and to love and to cherish till death us do part....
The bookcase of Delilahs, that you have paid wicked prices
for, that you love without pretending to be reasonable about
it, and would bag in case of fire before all the rest.&mdash;<span class="smcap">O.

<h3>DEFINITIONS</h3>

<p>To afford the reader an opportunity of noting at a glance
the appropriate learned terms applicable to the different
sets of persons who meddle with books, I subjoin the following
definitions, as rendered in d'Israeli's <i>Curiosities</i> from the
<i>Chasse aux Bibliographes et Antiquaires mal advisés</i> of Jean-Joseph
Rive:</p>

<p>'A bibliognoste, from the Greek, is one knowing in title-pages
and colophons, and in editions; the place and year
when printed; the presses whence issued; and all the
minutiae of a book.'</p>

<p>'A bibliographe is a describer of books and other literary
arrangements.'</p>

<p>'A bibliomane is an indiscriminate accumulator, who
blunders faster than he buys, cock-brained and purse-heavy.'</p>

<p>'A bibliophile, the lover of books, is the only one in the
class who appears to read them for his own pleasure.'</p>

<p>'A bibliotaphe buries his books, by keeping them under
lock, or framing them in glass cases.'</p>

<p>The accurate Peignot, after accepting of this classification
with high admiration of its simplicity and exhaustiveness,
is seized in his supplementary volume with a misgiving in
the matter of the bibliotaphe, explaining that it ought to
be translated as a grave of books, and that the proper
technical expression for the performer referred to by Rive
is bibliotapht. He adds to the nomenclature bibliolyte, as
a destroyer of books; bibliologue, one who discourses about
books; bibliotacte, a classifier of books; and bibliopée
'l'art d'écrire ou de composer des livres', or, as the unlearned
would say, the function of an author.&mdash;<span class="smcap">J. H. Burton.</span>
<i>The Book Hunter.</i></p>


<h3>THE LAST EDITIONS THE BEST</h3>

<p>Buy good books, and read them; the best books are the
commonest, and the last editions are always the best, if
the editors are not blockheads; for they may profit of the
former. But take care not to understand editions and
title-pages too well. It always smells of pedantry, and not
always of learning.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Lord Chesterfield.</span> <i>Letters to his
Son.</i></p>

<h3>OF HANDLING BOOKS</h3>

<p>We not only set before ourselves a service to God in
preparing volumes of new books, but we exercise the duties
of a holy piety if we just handle so as not to injure them,
then return them to their proper places, and commend them
to undefiling custody that they may rejoice in their purity
while held in the hand, and repose in security when laid
up in their repositories....</p>

<p>In the first place, then, let there be a mature decorum
in opening and closing of volumes, that they may neither
be unclasped with precipitous haste, nor thrown aside
after inspection without being duly closed; for it is
necessary that a book should be much more carefully
preserved than a shoe....</p>

<p>A stiff-necked youth, lounging sluggishly in his study ...
distributes innumerable straws in various places, with the
ends in sight, that he may recall by the mark what his
memory cannot retain.... He is not ashamed to eat fruit
and cheese over an open book, and to transfer his empty
cup from side to side upon it: and because he has not his
alms-bag at hand, he leaves the rest of the fragments in his
books.... He next reclines with his elbows on the book,
and by a short study invites a long nap; and by way of
repairing the wrinkles, he twists back the margins of the
leaves, to the no small detriment of the volume....</p>

<p>But impudent boys are to be specially restrained from
meddling with books, who, when they are learning to
draw the forms of letters, if copies of the most beautiful
books are allowed them, begin to become incongruous
annotators, and wherever they perceive the broadest
margin about the text, they furnish it with a monstrous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
alphabet, or their unchastened pen immediately presumes
to draw any other frivolous thing whatever, that occurs
to their imagination.... There are also certain thieves who
enormously dismember books by cutting off the side
margins for letter paper, leaving only the letters or text,
or the fly-leaves put in for the preservation of the book,
which they take away for various uses and abuses, which
sort of sacrilege ought to be prohibited under a threat of
anathema.</p>

<p>But it is altogether befitting the decency of a scholar
that washing should without fail precede reading, as often
as he returns from his meals to study, before his fingers,
besmeared with grease, loosen a clasp or turn over the leaf
of a book.&mdash;<span class="smcap">R. de Bury.</span> <i>Philobiblon.</i></p>


<h3>DEDUCTIONS FROM SCRIPTURE</h3>

<p>The most meek Moses instructs us about making cases
for books in the neatest manner, wherein they may be
safely preserved from all damage. 'Take this book,'
says he, 'and put it in the side of the ark of the covenant
of the Lord your God' (Deut. xxxi). O, befitting place,
appropriate library, which was made of imperishable Shittim
wood, and covered all over inside and out with gold! But
our Saviour also, by his own example, precludes all unseemly
negligence in the treatment of books, as may be
read in Luke iv. For when he had read over the scriptural
prophecy written about himself in a book debarred to him,
he did not return it to the minister till he had first closed
it with his most holy hands; by which act students are
most clearly taught that they ought not in the smallest
degree whatever to be negligent about the custody of books.&mdash;<span class="smcap">R.

<h3>CARE AS TO BINDINGS</h3>

<p>Have a care of keeping your books handsome, and well
bound, not casting away overmuch in their gilding or
stringing for ostentation sake, like the prayer-books of
girls and gallants, which are carried to church but for
their outsides. Yet for your own use spare them not for
noting or interlining (if they be printed), for it is not
likely you mean to be a gainer by them, when you have
done with them: neither suffer them through negligence
to mould and be moth-eaten or want their strings and
covers. King Alphonsus, about to lay the foundation of
a castle at Naples, called for Vitruvius his book of architecture;
the book was brought in very bad case, all dusty
and without covers; which the king observing said, 'He
that must cover us all, must not go uncovered himself';
then commanded the book to be fairly bound and brought
unto him. So say I, suffer them not to lie neglected, who
must make you regarded; and go in torn coats, who must
apparel your mind with the ornaments of knowledge,
above the robes and riches of the most magnificent princes.&mdash;<span class="smcap">H.

and dazzling cut, that seems to float amidst a satin sea
of cream&mdash;(it is impossible to be watching after one's
metaphors on such inspiring occasions)&mdash;roves, in gazing
ecstasy, from page to page, till here and there arrested
by the choice vignette or richly tinctured plate: at length,
'lassatus, necdum satiatus' with the beauties of the
interior, he reverently closes the superbly-plated leaves;
and, turning to the sumptuous, silk-lined cover, marvels
as he views the verdant, red, or purple pride of Russia,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>

<h3>DISCRIMINATION IN BINDINGS</h3>

<p>To be strong-backed and neat-bound is the desideratum
of a volume. Magnificence comes after. This, when it can
be afforded, is not to be lavished upon all kinds of books
indiscriminately. I would not dress a set of Magazines,
for instance, in full suit. The dishabille, or half-binding
(with Russia backs ever) is <i>our</i> costume. A Shakespeare,
or a Milton (unless the first editions), it were mere foppery
to trick out in gay apparel. The possession of them confers
no distinction. The exterior of them (the things themselves
being so common), strange to say, raises no sweet emotions,
no tickling sense of property in the owner. Thomson's
<i>Seasons</i>, again, looks best (I maintain it) a little torn,
and dog's-eared. How beautiful to a genuine lover of
reading are the sullied leaves, and worn out appearance,
nay, the very odour (beyond Russia), if we would not
forget kind feelings in fastidiousness, of an old 'Circulating
Library' <i>Tom Jones</i>, or <i>Vicar of Wakefield</i>! How they
speak of the thousand thumbs, that have turned over their
pages with delight!&mdash;of the lone sempstress, whom they
may have cheered (milliner, or harder-working mantua-maker)
after her long day's needle-toil, running far into
midnight, when she has snatched an hour, ill spared from
sleep, to steep her cares, as in some Lethean cup, in spelling
out their enchanting contents! Who would have them a
whit less soiled? What better condition could we desire
to see them in?</p>

<p>In some respects the better a book is, the less it demands
from binding. Fielding, Smollett, Sterne, and all that
class of perpetually self-reproductive volumes&mdash;Great
Nature's Stereotypes&mdash;we see them individually perish with
less regret, because we know the copies of them to be
'eterne'. But where a book is at once both good and
rare&mdash;where the individual is almost the species, and when
<i>that</i> perishes,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">We know not where is that Promethean torch<br /></span>
<span class="i1">That can its light relumine&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>such a book, for instance, as the <i>Life of the Duke of Newcastle</i>,
by his Duchess&mdash;no casket is rich enough, no casing
sufficiently durable, to honour and keep safe such a jewel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span></p>

<p>Not only rare volumes of this description, which seem
hopeless ever to be reprinted; but old editions of writers,
such as Sir Philip Sidney, Bishop Taylor, Milton in his
prose works, Fuller&mdash;of whom we <i>have</i> reprints, yet the
books themselves, though they go about, and are talked
of here and there, we know, have not endenizened themselves
(nor possibly ever will) in the national heart, so as
to become stock books&mdash;it is good to possess these in
durable and costly covers. I do not care for a First Folio
of Shakespeare. I rather prefer the common editions of
Rowe and Tonson, without notes, and with <i>plates</i>, which,
being so execrably bad, serve as maps, or modest remembrancers
to the text; and without pretending to any
supposable emulation with it, are so much better than the
Shakespeare gallery <i>engravings</i>, which <i>did</i>. I have a community
of feeling with my countrymen about his Plays,
and I like those editions of him best, which have been
oftenest tumbled about and handled.&mdash;On the contrary,
I cannot read Beaumont and Fletcher but in Folio. The
Octavo editions are painful to look at. I have no sympathy
with them. If they were as much read as the current
editions of the other poet, I should prefer them in that
shape to the older one. I do not know a more heartless
sight than the reprint of the <i>Anatomy of Melancholy</i>.
What need was there of unearthing the bones of that
fantastic old great man, to expose them in a winding-sheet
of the newest fashion to modern censure? what hapless
stationer could dream of Burton ever becoming popular?&mdash;The
wretched Malone could not do worse, when he bribed
the sexton of Stratford Church to let him white-wash the
painted effigy of old Shakespeare, which stood there, in
rude but lively fashion depicted, to the very colour of the
cheek, the eye, the eyebrow, hair, the very dress he used
to wear&mdash;the only authentic testimony we had, however
imperfect, of these curious parts and parcels of him. They
covered him over with a coat of white paint. By&mdash;&mdash;, if
I had been a justice of peace for Warwickshire, I would
have clapt both commentator and sexton fast in the stocks,
for a pair of meddling sacrilegious varlets.</p>

<p>I think I see them at their work&mdash;these sapient trouble-tombs.&mdash;<span class="smcap">C.

<h3>SUITABLE BINDINGS</h3>

<p>Books, no less than their authors, are liable to get
ragged, and to experience that neglect and contempt which
generally follows the outward and visible signs of poverty.
We do therefore most heartily commend the man, who
bestows on a tattered and shivering volume such decent
and comely apparel as may protect it from the insults of
the vulgar, and the more cutting slights of the fair. But
if it be a rare book, 'the lone survivor of a numerous race,'
the one of its family that has escaped the trunk-makers
and pastry-cooks, we would counsel a little extravagance
in arranging it. Let no book perish, unless it be such an
one as it is your duty to throw into the fire. There is no such
thing as a worthless book, though there are some far worse
than worthless; no book which is not worth preserving, if
its existence may be tolerated; as there are some men
whom it may be proper to hang, but none who should be
suffered to starve.</p>

<p>The binding of a book should always suit its complexion.
Pages, venerably yellow, should not be cased in military
morocco, but in sober brown russia. Glossy hot-pressed
paper looks best in vellum. We have sometimes seen
a collection of old whitey-brown black-letter ballads, &amp;c.,
so gorgeously tricked out, that they remind us of the
pious liberality of the Catholics, who dress in silk and gold
the images of saints, part of whose saintship consisted in
wearing rags and hair-cloth. The costume of a volume
should also be in keeping with its subject, and with the
character of its author. How absurd to see the works of
William Penn in flaming scarlet, and George Fox's Journal
in Bishop's purple! Theology should be solemnly gorgeous.
History should be ornamented after the antique or Gothic
fashion. Works of science, as plain as is consistent with
dignity. Poetry, <i>simplex munditiis</i>.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Hartley Coleridge.</span>

<h3>THE OUTSIDE OF A BOOK</h3>

<p>As great philosophers hold that the <i>esse</i> of things is
<i>percipi</i>, so a gentleman's furniture exists to be looked at.
Nevertheless, sir, there are some things more fit to be
looked at than others; for instance, there is nothing more
fit to be looked at than the outside of a book. It is, as
I may say, from repeated experience, a pure and unmixed
pleasure to have a goodly volume lying before you, and to
know that you may open it if you please, and need not open
it unless you please. It is a resource against <i>ennui</i>, if
<i>ennui</i> should come upon you. To have the resource and
not to feel the <i>ennui</i>, to enjoy your bottle in the present,
and your book in the indefinite future, is a delightful
condition of human existence. There is no place, in which
a man can move or sit, in which the outside of a book can
be otherwise than an innocent and becoming spectacle.&mdash;<span class="smcap">T.
L. Peacock.</span> <i>Crotchet Castle.</i></p>


<h3>BOOKS YOU MAY HOLD IN YOUR HAND</h3>

<p>Johnson used to say that no man read long together
with a folio on his table. 'Books,' said he, 'that you may
carry to the fire, and hold readily in your hand, are the
most useful after all.'&mdash;<span class="smcap">J. Boswell.</span> <i>Life of Johnson.</i></p>


<h3>BOOK ILLUSTRATIONS AND NIGHTMARE</h3>

<p>Of the great passion of Henry the Seventh for fine books,
even before he ascended the throne of England, there can
be no doubt. I will not, however, take upon me to say that
the slumbers of this monarch were disturbed in consequence
of the extraordinary and frightful passages, which, accompanied
with bizarre cuts, were now introduced into almost
every work, both of ascetic divinity, and also of plain
practical morality. His predecessor, Richard, had in all
probability been alarmed by the images which the reading
of these books had created; and I guess that it was from
such frightful objects, rather than from the ghosts of his
murdered brethren, that he was compelled to pass a sleepless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
night before the memorable battle of Bosworth Field. If
one of those artists who used to design the horrible pictures
which are engraved in many old didactic volumes of the
period, had ventured to take a peep into Richard's tent,
I question whether he would not have seen, lying upon
an oaken table, an early edition of some of those fearful
works of which he had himself aided in the embellishment,
and of which Heinecken has given us such curious facsimiles:
and this, in my humble apprehension, is quite sufficient to
account for all the terrible workings in Richard which
Shakespeare has so vividly described.&mdash;<span class="smcap">T. F. Dibdin.</span>

<h3>DELIGHT IN BOOK-PRINTS</h3>

<p>I yield to none in my love of bookstall urbanity. I have
spent as happy moments over the stalls (until the woman
looked out) as any literary apprentice boy who ought to
be moving onwards. But I confess my weakness in liking
to see some of my favourite purchases neatly bound. The
books I like to have about me most are Spenser, Chaucer,
the minor poems of Milton, the <i>Arabian Nights</i>, Theocritus,
Ariosto, and such old good-natured speculations as Plutarch's
<i>Morals</i>. For most of these I like a plain good
old binding, never mind how old, provided it wears well;
but my <i>Arabian Nights</i> may be bound in as fine and
flowery a style as possible, and I should love an engraving
to every dozen pages. Book-prints of all sorts, bad and
good, take with me as much as when I was a child: and
I think some books, such as Prior's <i>Poems</i>, ought always
to have portraits of the authors. Prior's airy face with
his cap on, is like having his company. From early association,
no edition of Milton pleases me so much, as that in
which there are pictures of the Devil with brute ears,
dressed like a Roman General: nor of Bunyan, as the one
containing the print of the Valley of the Shadow of Death,
with the Devil whispering in Christian's ear, or old Pope
by the wayside, and</p>

<p>I delight in the recollection of the puzzle I used to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
with the frontispiece of the <i>Tale of a Tub</i>, of my real horror
at the sight of that crawling old man representing Avarice,
at the beginning of <i>Enfield's Speaker</i>, the <i>Looking Glass</i>,
or some such book; and even of the careless schoolboy
hats, and the prim stomachers and cottage bonnets, of
such golden-age antiquities as the <i>Village School</i>. The
oldest and most worn-out woodcut, representing King
Pippin, Goody Two Shoes, or the grim Soldan, sitting with
three staring blots for his eyes and mouth, his sceptre in
one hand, and his other five fingers raised and spread in
admiration at the feats of the Gallant London Prentice,
cannot excite in me a feeling of ingratitude.&mdash;<span class="smcap">J. H. Leigh

<h3>ROYAL PATRONAGE OF BOOKS</h3>

<p>Queen Charlotte, when discussing books with Fanny
Burney and Mrs. Delany, during the former's residence at
Court at Windsor, praised the work of a writer who had
translated a German book into English, saying 'I wish
I knew the translator,' to which Miss Burney replied, 'I
wish the translator knew that!'</p>

<p>'Oh,' said the Queen,&mdash;'it is not&mdash;I should not like to
give my name, for fear I have judged ill: I picked it up on
a stall. Oh, it is amazing what good books there are on
stalls.'</p>

<p>'It is amazing to me,' said Mrs. Delany, 'to hear that.'</p>

<p>'Why, I don't pick them up myself; but I have a
servant very clever; and if they are not to be had at the
bookseller's, they are not for me any more than for another.'&mdash;From

<h3>THE TREASURE</h3>

<p>Do you remember the brown suit, which you made to
hang upon you, till all your friends cried shame upon
you, it grew so thread-bare&mdash;and all because of that folio
Beaumont and Fletcher, which you dragged home late at
night from Barker's in Covent-garden? Do you remember
how we eyed it for weeks before we could make up our
minds to the purchase, and had not come to a determination
till it was near ten o'clock of the Saturday night, when you
set off from Islington, fearing you should be too late&mdash;and
when the old bookseller with some grumbling opened his
shop, and by the twinkling taper (for he was setting bed-wards)
lighted out the relic from his dusty treasures&mdash;and
when you lugged it home, wishing it were twice as cumbersome&mdash;and
when you presented it to me&mdash;and when we
were exploring the perfectness of it (<i>collating</i> you called it)&mdash;and
while I was repairing some of the loose leaves with paste,
which your impatience would not suffer to be left till daybreak&mdash;was
there no pleasure in being a poor man? or can
those neat black clothes, which you wear now, and are so
careful to keep brushed, since we have become rich and
finical, give you half the honest vanity, with which you
flaunted it about in that over-worn suit&mdash;your old corbeau&mdash;for
four or five weeks longer than you should have done,
to pacify your conscience for the mighty sum of fifteen&mdash;or
sixteen shillings was it?&mdash;a great affair we thought it then&mdash;which
you had lavished on the old folio. Now you can afford
to buy any book that pleases you, but I do not see that you
ever bring me home any nice old purchases now.&mdash;<span class="smcap">C. Lamb.</span>

<h3>THE MOST VALUABLE BOOK</h3>

<p>We ought not to get books too cheaply. No book,
I believe, is ever worth half so much to its reader as one
that has been coveted for a year at a bookstall, and bought
out of saved halfpence; and perhaps a day or two's fasting.
That's the way to get at the cream of a book.&mdash;<span class="smcap">J. Ruskin.</span>

<h3>THE READERS AT THE BOOKSTALL</h3>

<p>There is a class of street-readers, whom I can never contemplate
without affection&mdash;the poor gentry, who, not
having wherewithal to buy or hire a book, filch a little
learning at the open stalls&mdash;the owner, with his hard eye,
casting envious looks at them all the while, and thinking
when they will have done. Venturing tenderly, page after
page, expecting every moment when he shall interpose his
interdict, and yet unable to deny themselves the gratification,
they 'snatch a fearful joy'. Martin B&mdash;&mdash;, in this
way, by daily fragments, got through two volumes of
Clarissa, when the stall-keeper damped his laudable ambition,
by asking him (it was in his younger days) whether he
meant to purchase the work. M. declares that under no circumstances
of his life did he ever peruse a book with half
the satisfaction which he took in those uneasy snatches.
A quaint poetess of our day has moralized upon this subject
in two very touching but homely stanzas:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I saw a boy with eager eye<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Open a book upon a stall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And read, as he'd devour it all;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which when the stall-man did espy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Soon to the boy I heard him call,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'You, Sir, you never buy a book,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Therefore in one you shall not look.'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The boy passed slowly on and with a sigh<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He wished he never had been taught to read,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then of the old churl's books he should have had no need.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Of sufferings the poor have many,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which never can the rich annoy:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I soon perceived another boy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who looked as if he'd not had any<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Food, for that day at least&mdash;enjoy<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sight of cold meat in a tavern larder.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This boy's case, then thought I, is surely harder,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus hungry, longing, thus without a penny,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beholding choice of dainty-dressèd meat:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No wonder if he wish he ne'er had learned to eat.<br /><br /></span>

<h3>THE SECOND-HAND CATALOGUE</h3>

<p>A Second-hand Bookseller's Catalogue is not a mere
catalogue or list of saleables, as the uninitiated may fancy.
Even a common auctioneer's catalogue of goods and
chattels suggests a thousand reflections to a peruser of any
knowledge; judge then what the case must be with a catalogue
of Books; the very titles of which run the rounds of
the whole world, visible and invisible; geographies&mdash;biographies&mdash;
histories&mdash;loves&mdash;hates&mdash;joys&mdash;sorrows&mdash;cookeries&mdash;sciences&mdash;fashion&mdash;and
eternity! We speak on this subject from the most literal experience;
for often and often have we cut open a new catalogue of old books, with all
the fervour and ivory folder of a first love; often read one
at tea; nay, at dinner; and have put crosses against
dozens of volumes in the list, out of the pure imagination
of buying them, the possibility being <i>out of the question</i>!&mdash;</p>

<p>Nothing delights us more than to overhaul some dingy
tome, and read a chapter gratuitously. Occasionally when
we have opened some very attractive old book, we have
stood reading for hours at the stall, lost in a brown study
and worldly forgetfulness, and should probably have read<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
on to the end of the last chapter, had not the vendor of
published wisdom offered, in a satirically polite way, to

tired.'&mdash;<span class="smcap">J. H. Leigh Hunt.</span> <i>Retrospective Review.</i></p>

<h3>PURCHASING AN ACT OF PIETY</h3>

<p>When Providence throws a good book in my way, I bow
to its decree and purchase it as an act of piety, if it is reasonably
or unreasonably cheap. I <i>adopt</i> a certain number of
books every year, out of a love for the foundlings and stray
children of other people's brains that nobody seems to care
for. Look here.</p>

<p>He took down a Greek Lexicon finely bound in calf, and
spread it open.</p>

<p>Do you see that Hedericus? I had Greek dictionaries
enough and to spare, but I saw that noble quarto lying in
the midst of an ignoble crowd of cheap books, and marked
with a price which I felt to be an insult to scholarship, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
the memory of Homer, sir, and the awful shade of Aeschylus,
I paid the mean price asked for it, and I wanted to double it,
but I suppose it would have been a foolish sacrifice of coin
to sentiment. I love that book for its looks and behaviour.
None of your 'half-calf' economies in that volume, sir!
And see how it lies open anywhere! There isn't a book in
my library that has such a generous way of laying its
treasures before you. From Alpha to Omega, calm, assured
rest at any page that your choice or accident may light on.
No lifting of a rebellious leaf like an upstart servant that
does not know his place and can never be taught manners,
but tranquil, well-bred repose. A book may be a perfect
gentleman in its aspect and demeanour, and this book
would be good company for personages like Roger Ascham
and his pupils the Lady Elizabeth and the Lady Jane Grey.&mdash;<span class="smcap">O. W.

<h3>THE VOCATION</h3>

<p>One of the shop-windows he paused before was that of
a second-hand book-shop, where, on a narrow table outside,
the literature of the ages was represented in judicious
mixture, from the immortal verse of Homer to the mortal
prose of the railway novel. That the mixture was judicious
was apparent from Deronda's finding in it something that
he wanted&mdash;namely, that wonderful bit of autobiography,
the life of the Polish Jew, Salomon Maimon; which, as he
could easily slip it into his pocket, he took from its place,
and entered the shop to pay for, expecting to see behind
the counter a grimy personage showing that nonchalance
about sales which seems to belong universally to the second-hand
book-business. In most other trades you find generous
men who are anxious to sell you their wares for your own
welfare; but even a Jew will not urge Simson's Euclid on
you with an affectionate assurance that you will have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
pleasure in reading it, and that he wishes he had twenty
more of the article, so much is it in request. One is led to
fear that a second-hand bookseller may belong to that
unhappy class of men who have no belief in the good of
what they get their living by, yet keep conscience enough
to be morose rather than unctuous in their vocation.&mdash;<span class="smcap">G.

<h3>IN BONDAGE TO THE BOOKSELLER</h3>

<p>Nevertheless conceive me not, I pray you, that I go
about to lay a general imputation upon all stationers. For
to disparage the whole profession were an act neither
becoming an honest man to do, nor a prudent auditory to
suffer. Their mystery, as they not untruly term it, consists
of divers trades incorporated together: as printers, book-binders,
clasp-makers, booksellers, &amp;c. And of all these be
some honest men, who to my knowledge are so grieved,
being overborne by the notorious oppressions and proceedings
of the rest, that they have wished themselves of some
other calling. The printers' mystery is ingenious, painful,
and profitable: the book-binders' necessary; the clasp-makers'
useful. And indeed, the retailer of books, commonly
called a bookseller, is a trade, which, being well
governed and limited within certain bounds, might become
somewhat serviceable to the rest. But as it is now, for the
most part abused, the bookseller hath not only made the
printer, the binder, and the clasp-maker a slave to him:
but hath brought authors, yea, the whole Commonwealth,
and all the liberal sciences into bondage. For he makes all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
professors of Art labour for his profit, at his own price, and
utters it to the Commonwealth in such fashion, and at
those rates, which please himself. Insomuch, that I wonder
so insupportable and so impertinent a thing as a mere
bookseller, considering what the profession is become now,
was ever permitted to grow up in the Commonwealth.&mdash;<span class="smcap">G.

<h3>LITERARY UPHOLSTERERS</h3>

<p>Our booksellers here at London disgrace literature by
the trash they bespeak to be written, and at the same time
prevent everything else from being sold. They are little
more or less than upholsterers, who sell <i>sets</i> or <i>bodies</i> of arts
and sciences for furniture; and the purchasers, for I am
very sure they are not readers, buy only in that view. I
never thought there was much merit in reading: but yet it
is too good a thing to be put upon no better footing than
damask and mahogany.&mdash;<span class="smcap">H. Walpole. Earl of Orford</span>

<h3>WHAT A HEART-BREAKING SHOP</h3>

<p>But what were even gold and silver, precious stones and
clockwork, to the bookshops, whence a pleasant smell of
paper freshly pressed came issuing forth, awakening instant
recollections of some new grammar had at school, long time
ago, with 'Master Pinch, Grove House Academy', inscribed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
in faultless writing on the fly-leaf! That whiff of russia
leather, too, and all those rows on rows of volumes, neatly
ranged within: what happiness did they suggest! And
in the window were the spick-and-span new works from
London, with the title-pages, and sometimes even the first
page of the first chapter, laid wide open: tempting unwary
men to begin to read the book, and then, in the impossibility
of turning over, to rush blindly in, and buy it! Here too
were the dainty frontispiece and trim vignette, pointing
like handposts on the outskirts of great cities, to the rich
stock of incident beyond; and store of books, with many
a grave portrait and time-honoured name, whose matter
he knew well, and would have given mines to have, in any
form, upon the narrow shelf beside his bed at Mr. Pecksniff's.
What a heart-breaking shop it was!&mdash;<span class="smcap">C. Dickens.</span>
<i>Martin Chuzzlewit.</i></p>


<h3>GENTEEL ORNAMENTS</h3>

<p>If people bought no more books than they intended to
read, and no more swords than they intended to use, the
two worst trades in Europe would be a bookseller's and
a sword-cutler's; but luckily for both they are reckoned
genteel ornaments.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Lord Chesterfield.</span></p>


<h3>MAMMON AND BOOKS</h3>

<p>All who are affected by the love of books hold worldly
affairs and money very cheap, as Jerome writes to Vigilantius
(Epist. 54): 'It is not for the same man to ascertain
the value of gold coins and of writings;' which somebody
thus repeated in verse:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">No tinker's hand shall dare a book to stain;<br /></span>
<span class="i3">No miser's heart can wish a book to gain;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The gold assayer cannot value books;<br /></span>
<span class="i3">On them the epicure disdainful looks.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">One house at once, believe me, cannot hold<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Lovers of books and hoarders up of gold.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>No man, therefore, can serve mammon and books.&mdash;<span class="smcap">R. de
Bury.</span> <i>Philobiblon.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span></p>


<h3>THE POOR STUDENT</h3>

<p>In the depth of college shades, or in his lonely chamber,
the poor student shrunk from observation. He found
shelter among books, which insult not; and studies, that
ask no questions of a youth's finances. He was lord of
his library, and seldom cared for looking out beyond his
domains.&mdash;<span class="smcap">C. Lamb.</span> <i>Poor Relations.</i></p>


<h3>NATIONAL EXPENDITURE ON BOOKS</h3>

<p>I say first we have despised literature. What do we,
as a nation, care about books? How much do you think
we spend altogether on our libraries, public or private, as
compared with what we spend on our horses? If a man
spends lavishly on his library, you call him mad&mdash;a bibliomaniac.
But you never call any one a horse-maniac,
though men ruin themselves every day by their horses,
and you do not hear of people ruining themselves by their
books. Or, to go lower still, how much do you think the
contents of the book-shelves of the United Kingdom, public
and private, would fetch, as compared with the contents
of its wine-cellars? What position would its expenditure
on literature take, as compared with its expenditure on
luxurious eating? We talk of food for the mind, as of
food for the body: now a good book contains such food
inexhaustibly; it is a provision for life, and for the best
part of us; yet how long most people would look at the
best book before they would give the price of a large turbot
for it! Though there have been men who have pinched
their stomachs and bared their backs to buy a book, whose
libraries were cheaper to them, I think, in the end, than
most men's dinners are. We are few of us put to such
trial, and more the pity; for, indeed, a precious thing is
all the more precious to us if it has been won by work
or economy; and if public libraries were half as costly as
public dinners, or books cost the tenth part of what bracelets
do, even foolish men and women might sometimes
suspect there was good in reading, as well as in munching
and sparkling; whereas the very cheapness of literature
is making even wise people forget that if a book is worth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
reading, it is worth buying. No book is worth anything
which is not worth <i>much</i>; nor is it serviceable until it
has been read, and re-read, and loved, and loved again;
and marked, so that you can refer to the passages you
want in it, as a soldier can seize the weapon he needs in
an armoury, or a housewife bring the spice she needs from
her store. Bread of flour is good; but there is bread,
sweet as honey, if we would eat it, in a good book; and
the family must be poor indeed which, once in their lives,
cannot, for such multipliable barley-loaves, pay their
baker's bill. We call ourselves a rich nation, and we are
filthy and foolish enough to thumb each other's books out
of circulating libraries!&mdash;<span class="smcap">J. Ruskin.</span> <i>Sesame and Lilies.</i></p>


<h3>THE VALUE OF BOOK BORROWING</h3>

<p>I have sent you the Philosophy&mdash;books you writ to me
for; anything that you want of this kind for the advancement
of your studies, do but write, and I shall furnish you.
When I was a student as you are, my practice was to borrow
rather than buy, some sort of books, and to be always
punctual in restoring them upon the day assigned, and in
the interim to swallow of them as much as made for my
turn. This obliged me to read them through with more
haste to keep my word, whereas I had not been so careful
to peruse them had they been my own books, which I knew
were always ready at my dispose.&mdash;<span class="smcap">J. Howell.</span> <i>Familiar
Letters.</i></p>


<h3>ACCIDENTS TO BOOKS</h3>

<p>Fortunate are those who only consider a book for the
utility and pleasure they may derive from its possession.
Those students who, though they know much, still thirst
to know more, may require this vast sea of books; yet in
that sea they may suffer many shipwrecks.</p>

<p>Great collections of books are subject to certain accidents
besides the damp, the worms, and the rats; one not less
common is that of the <i>borrowers</i>, not to say a word of the
<i>purloiners</i>!&mdash;<span class="smcap">I. d'Israeli.</span> <i>Curiosities of Literature.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span></p>


<h3>BORROWERS OF BOOKS</h3>

<p>To one like Elia, whose treasures are rather cased in
leather covers than closed in iron coffers, there is a class
of alienators more formidable than that which I have
touched upon; I mean your <i>borrowers of books</i>&mdash;those
mutilators of collections, spoilers of the symmetry of shelves,
and creators of odd volumes. There is Comberbatch [Coleridge],
matchless in his depredations!</p>

<p>That foul gap in the bottom shelf facing you, like a great
eye-tooth knocked out&mdash;(you are now with me in my little
back study in Bloomsbury, reader!)&mdash;with the huge Switzer-like
tomes on each side (like the Guildhall giants, in their
reformed posture, guardant of nothing), once held the tallest
of my folios, <i>Opera Bonaventurae</i>, choice and massy divinity,
to which its two supporters (school divinity also, but of
a lesser calibre,&mdash;Bellarmine, and Holy Thomas), showed
but as dwarfs,&mdash;itself an Ascapart!&mdash;<i>that</i> Comberbatch
abstracted upon the faith of a theory he holds, which is
more easy, I confess, for me to suffer by than to refute,
namely, that 'the title to property in a book (my Bonaventure,
for instance), is in exact ratio to the claimant's
powers of understanding and appreciating the same'.
Should he go on acting upon this theory, which of our
shelves is safe?</p>

<p>The slight vacuum in the left-hand case&mdash;two shelves
from the ceiling&mdash;scarcely distinguishable but by the quick
eye of a loser&mdash;was whilom the commodious resting-place
of Browne on Urn Burial. C. will hardly allege that he
knows more about that treatise than I do, who introduced
it to him, and was indeed the first (of the moderns) to
discover its beauties&mdash;but so have I known a foolish lover
to praise his mistress in the presence of a rival more qualified
to carry her off than himself.&mdash;Just below, Dodsley's dramas
want their fourth volume, where Vittoria Corombona is!
The remainder nine are as distasteful as Priam's refuse
sons, when the Fates <i>borrowed</i> Hector. Here stood the
Anatomy of Melancholy, in sober state.&mdash;There loitered the
Complete Angler; quiet as in life, by some stream side.&mdash;In
yonder nook, John Buncle, a widower-volume, with
'eyes closed', mourns his ravished mate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span></p>

<p>One justice I must do my friend, that if he sometimes,
like the sea, sweeps away a treasure, at another time, sea-like,
he throws up as rich an equivalent to match it. I have
a small under-collection of this nature (my friend's gatherings
in his various calls), picked up, he has forgotten at
what odd places, and deposited with as little memory as
mine. I take in these orphans, the twice-deserted. These
proselytes of the gate are welcome as the true Hebrews.
There they stand in conjunction; natives, and naturalised.
The latter seem as little disposed to inquire out their true
lineage as I am.&mdash;I charge no warehouse-room for these
deodands, nor shall ever put myself to the ungentlemanly
trouble of advertising a sale of them to pay expenses.</p>

<p>To lose a volume to C. carries some sense and meaning
in it. You are sure that he will make one hearty meal
on your viands, if he can give no account of the platter
after it. But what moved thee, wayward, spiteful K., to
be so importunate to carry off with thee, in spite of tears
and adjurations to thee to forbear, the Letters of that
princely woman, the thrice noble Margaret Newcastle?&mdash;knowing
at the time, and knowing that I knew also, thou
most assuredly wouldst never turn over one leaf of the
illustrious folio:&mdash;what but the mere spirit of contradiction,
and childish love of getting the better of thy friend?&mdash;Then,
worst cut of all! to transport it with thee to the Gallican
land&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">Unworthy land to harbour such a sweetness,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">A virtue in which all ennobling thoughts dwelt,<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>&mdash;hadst thou not thy play-books, and books of jests and
fancies, about thee, to keep thee merry, even as thou
keepest all companies with thy quips and mirthful tales?&mdash;Child
of the Green-room, it was unkindly done of thee.
Thy wife, too, that part-French, better-part Englishwoman!&mdash;that
<i>she</i> could fix upon no other treatise to bear away
in kindly token of remembering us, than the works of
Fulke Greville, Lord Brooke&mdash;of which no Frenchman, nor
woman of France, Italy, or England, was ever by nature
constituted to comprehend a tittle! <i>Was there not Zimmerman

<p>Reader, if haply thou art blessed with a moderate collection,
be shy of showing it; or if thy heart overfloweth to
lend them, lend thy books; but let it be to such a one as
S. T. C.&mdash;he will return them (generally anticipating the
time appointed) with usury; enriched with annotations,
tripling their value. I have had experience. Many are
these precious MSS. of his&mdash;(in <i>matter</i> oftentimes, and
almost in <i>quantity</i> not unfrequently, vying with the originals)&mdash;in
no very clerky hand&mdash;legible in my Daniel; in
old Burton; in Sir Thomas Browne; and those abstruser
cogitations of the Greville, now, alas! wandering in Pagan
lands.&mdash;I counsel thee, shut not thy heart, nor thy library,
against S. T. C.&mdash;<span class="smcap">C. Lamb.</span> <i>The Two Races of Men.</i></p>


<h3>BORROWING AND LENDING</h3>

<p>I own I borrow books with as much facility as I lend.
I cannot see a work that interests me on another person's
shelf, without a wish to carry it off: but, I repeat, that
I have been much more sinned against than sinning in the
article of non-return; and am scrupulous in the article of
intention.&mdash;<span class="smcap">J. H. Leigh Hunt.</span> <i>My Books.</i></p>


<h3>WEDDED TO BOOKS</h3>

<p>If people are to be wedded to their books, it is hard that,
under our present moral dispensations, they are not to be
allowed the usual exclusive privileges of marriage. A friend
thinks no more of borrowing a book nowadays, than a
Roman did of borrowing a man's wife; and what is worse,
we are so far gone in our immoral notions on this subject,
that we even lend it as easily as Cato did his spouse. Now
what a happy thing ought it not to be to have exclusive
possession of a book,&mdash;one's Shakespeare for instance; for
the finer the wedded work, the more anxious of course we
should be, that it should give nobody happiness but ourselves.
Think of the pleasure of not only being with it in
general, of having by far the greater part of its company,
but of having it entirely to oneself; of always saying
internally, 'It is my property'; of seeing it well-dressed
in 'black or red', purely to please one's own eyes; of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
wondering how any fellow could be so impudent as to
propose borrowing it for an evening; of being at once
proud of his admiration, and pretty certain that it was in
vain; of the excitement nevertheless of being a little uneasy
whenever we saw him approach it too nearly; of wishing
that it could give him a cuff of the cheek with one of its
beautiful boards, for presuming to like its beauties as well
as ourselves; of liking other people's books, but not at
all thinking it proper that they should like ours; of getting
perhaps indifferent to it, and then comforting ourselves
with the reflection that others are not so, though to no
purpose; in short, of all the mixed transport and anxiety
to which the exclusiveness of the book-wedded state would
be liable; not to mention the impossibility of other people's
having any literary offspring from our fair unique, and
consequently of the danger of loving any compilations but
our own. Really, if we could burn all other copies of our
originals, as the Roman Emperor once thought of destroying
Homer, this system would be worth thinking of. If we
had a good library, we should be in the situation of the
Turks with their seraglios, which are a great improvement
upon our petty exclusivenesses. Nobody could then touch
our Shakespeare, our Spenser, our Chaucer, our Greek and
Italian writers. People might say, 'Those are the walls
of the library!' and 'sigh, and look, and sigh again'; but
they should never get in. No Retrospective rake should
anticipate our privileges of quotation. Our Mary Wollstonecrafts
and our Madame de Staëls&mdash;no one should
know how finely they were lettered,&mdash;what soul there was
in their disquisitions. We once had a glimpse of the feelings
which people would have on these occasions. It was in
the library of Trinity College, Cambridge. The keeper of
it was from home; and not being able to get a sight of
the manuscript of Milton's <i>Comus</i>, we were obliged to content
ourselves with looking through a wire-work, a kind
of safe, towards the shelf on which it reposed. How we
winked, and yearned, and imagined we saw a corner of the
all-precious sheets, to no purpose! The feelings were not
very pleasant, it is true; but then as long as they were
confined to others, they would of course only add to our
satisfaction.&mdash;<span class="smcap">J. H. Leigh Hunt.</span> <i>Wedded to Books.</i></p>

<h3>READ THE SCRIPTURES</h3>

<p>Read the Scriptures, which Hyperius holds available
of itself; 'the mind is erected thereby from all worldly
cares, and hath much quiet and tranquillity.' For, as Austin
well hath it, 'tis <i>scientia scientiarum, omni melle dulcior,
omni pane suavior, omni vino hilarior</i>: 'tis the best nepenthe,
surest cordial, sweetest alterative, presentest diverter: for
neither as Chrysostom well adds, 'those boughs and leaves
of trees which are plashed for cattle to stand under, in the
heat of the day, in summer, so much refresh them with
their acceptable shade, as the reading of the Scripture
doth recreate and comfort a distressed soul, in sorrow and
affliction.' Paul bids us 'pray continually'; <i>quod cibus
corpori, lectio animae facit</i>, saith Seneca, 'as meat is to the
body, such is reading to the soul.' 'To be at leisure without
books is another hell, and to be buried alive.' Cardan calls
a library the physic of the soul; 'Divine authors fortify the
mind, make men bold and constant'; and (as Hyperius adds)
'godly conference will not permit the mind to be tortured
with absurd cogitations.'&mdash;<span class="smcap">R. Burton.</span> <i>The Anatomy of

<h3>'I READ ONLY THE BIBLE'</h3>

<p>Read the most useful books, and that regularly, and
constantly. Steadily spend all the morning in this employ,
or, at least, five hours in four-and-twenty.</p>

<p>'But I read only the Bible.' Then you ought to teach
others to read only the Bible, and, by parity of reason, to
hear only the Bible. But if so, you need preach no more.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
'Just so,' said George Bell. 'And what is the fruit? Why,
now he neither reads the Bible, nor anything else. This
is rank enthusiasm.' If you need no book but the Bible,
you are got above St. Paul. He wanted others too. 'Bring
the books,' says he, 'but especially the parchments,' those
wrote on parchment. 'But I have no taste for reading.'
Contract a taste for it by use, or return to your trade.&mdash;<span class="smcap">J.
Wesley.</span> <i>Minutes of Some Late Conversations.</i></p>


<h3>A MAN OF ONE BOOK</h3>

<p>I want to know one thing,&mdash;the way to heaven; how
to land safe on the happy shore. God himself has condescended
to teach me the way. For this very end He
came from heaven. He hath written it down in a book.
O give me the book! At any price, give me the book of
God. I have it: here is knowledge enough for me. Let
me be <i>homo unius libri</i>. Here then I am, far from the busy
ways of men. I sit down alone; only God is here. In His
presence I open, I read His book.... And what I thus
learn, that I teach.&mdash;<span class="smcap">J. Wesley.</span> <i>Preface to Sermons.</i></p>


<h3>HOMO UNIUS LIBRI</h3>

<p>When St. Thomas Aquinas was asked in what manner
a man might best become learned, he answered, 'By reading
one book.' The <i>homo unius libri</i> is indeed proverbially
formidable to all conversational figurantes.&mdash;<span class="smcap">R. Southey.</span>

<h3>THE SCRIPTURES: WHAT ARE THEY?</h3>

<p>I remember he alleged many a scripture, but those
I valued not; the scriptures, thought I, what are they?
A dead letter, a little ink and paper, of three or four shillings
price. Alas! What is the scripture? Give me a ballad,
a news-book, George on horseback, or Bevis of Southampton;
give me some book that teaches curious arts, that
tells of old fables; but for the holy scriptures I cared not.&mdash;<span class="smcap">J.

<h3>'THE PILGRIM'S PROGRESS'</h3>

<p>I know of no book, the Bible excepted, as above all
comparison, which I, according to my judgement and
experience, could so safely recommend as teaching and
enforcing the whole saving truth according to the mind
that was in Christ Jesus, as the <i>Pilgrim's Progress</i>. It is,
in my conviction, incomparably the best <i>summa theologiae
evangelicae</i> ever produced by a writer not miraculously
inspired.</p>

<p>This wonderful work is one of the few books which may
be read repeatedly at different times, and each time with
a new and different pleasure. I read it once as a theologian&mdash;and
let me assure you that there is great theological
acumen in the work&mdash;once with devotional feelings&mdash;and
once as a poet. I could not have believed beforehand that
Calvinism could be painted in such exquisitely delightful
colours....</p>

<p>The <i>Pilgrim's Progress</i> is composed in the lowest style of
English, without slang or false grammar. If you were to
polish it, you would at once destroy the reality of the
vision. For works of imagination should be written in
very plain language; the more imaginative they are the
more necessary it is to be plain.&mdash;<span class="smcap">S. T. Coleridge.</span> <i>Table
Talk.</i></p>


<h3>NO BOOK LIKE THE BIBLE</h3>

<p>I would have you every morning read a portion of
the Holy Scriptures, till you have read the Bible from the
beginning to the end: observe it well, read it reverently
and attentively, set your heart upon it, and lay it up in
your memory and make it the direction of your life: it
will make you a wise and a good man. I have been acquainted
somewhat with men and books, and have had
long experience in learning, and in the world: there is no
book like the Bible for excellent learning, wisdom, and use;
and it is want of understanding in them that think or speak
otherwise.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Sir M. Hale.</span> <i>A Letter to one of his Sons, after

<h3>THE BOOK OF BOOKS</h3>

<p>No man was a greater lover of books than he [Shelley].
He was rarely to be seen, unless attending to other people's
affairs, without a volume of some sort, generally of Plato
or one of the Greek tragedians. Nor will those who understand
the real spirit of his scepticism, be surprised to hear
that one of his companions was the Bible. He valued it
for the beauty of some of its contents, for the dignity of
others, and the curiosity of all; though the philosophy
of Solomon he thought too <i>Epicurean</i>, and the inconsistencies
of other parts afflicted him. His favourite part was
the book of Job, which he thought the grandest of tragedies.
He projected founding one of his own upon it; and I will
undertake to say, that Job would have sat in that tragedy
with a patience and profundity of thought worthy of the
original. Being asked on one occasion, what book he
would save for himself if he could save no other? he
answered, 'The oldest book, the Bible.'&mdash;<span class="smcap">J. H. Leigh Hunt.</span>

<h3>A VERY PRICELESS THING</h3>

<p>Precious temporal things are growing [in these years of
peace]; priceless spiritual things. We know the Shakespeare
Dramaturgy; the Rare-Ben and Elder-Dramatist
affair; which has now reached its culmination. Yes; and
precisely when the Wit-combats at the Mermaid are waning
somewhat, and our Shakespeare is about packing up for
Stratford,&mdash;there comes out another very priceless thing;
a correct Translation of the Bible; that which we still use.
Priceless enough this latter; of importance unspeakable!
Reynolds and Chadderton petitioned for it, at the Hampton-Court
Conference, long since; and now, in 1611, by labour
of Reynolds, Chadderton, Dr. Abbot, and other prodigiously
learned and earnest persons, 'forty-seven in number,' it
comes out beautifully printed; dedicated to the Dread
Sovereign; really in part a benefit of his to us. And so
we have it here to read, that Book of Books: 'barbarous
enough to rouse, tender enough to assuage, and possessing
how many other properties,' says Goethe;&mdash;possessing this
property, inclusive of all, add we, That it is written under
the eye of the Eternal; that it is of a Sincerity like very
Death; the truest Utterance that ever came by Alphabetic
Letters from the Soul of Man. Through which, as through
a window divinely opened, all men could look, and can
still look, beyond the visual Air-firmaments and mysterious
Time-oceans, into the Light-sea of Infinitude, into the
stillness of Eternity; and discern in glimpses, with such
emotions and practical suggestions as there may be, their
far-distant, longforgotten Home.&mdash;<span class="smcap">T. Carlyle.</span> <i>Historical
Sketches.</i></p>


<h3>MATERIAL FOR POESY</h3>

<p>What can we imagine more proper for the ornaments of
wit and learning in the story of Deucalion than in that
of Noah? Why will not the actions of Samson afford as
plentiful matter as the labours of Hercules? Why is not
Jephthah's daughter as good a woman as Iphigenia? and
the friendship of David and Jonathan more worthy celebration
than that of Theseus and Pirithous? Does not the
passage of Moses and the Israelites into the Holy Land<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
yield incomparably more poetic variety than the voyages
of Ulysses or Aeneas? Are the obsolete, threadbare tales
of Thebes and Troy half so stored with great, heroical, and
supernatural actions (since verse will needs find or make
such) as the wars of Joshua, of the Judges, of David, and
divers others?... All the books of the Bible are either
already most admirable and exalted pieces of poesy, or are
the best material in the world for it.&mdash;<span class="smcap">A. Cowley.</span> <i>Preface

<h3>A STANDARD FOR LANGUAGE</h3>

<p>It is your lordship's observation, that if it were not for
the Bible and Common Prayer Book in the vulgar tongue,
we should hardly be able to understand anything that
was written among us a hundred years ago; which is
certainly true: for those books, being perpetually read in
churches, have proved a kind of standard for language,
especially to the common people.... As to the greatest
parts of our liturgy, compiled long before the translation of
the Bible now in use, and little altered since, these seem to
be in as great strains of true sublime eloquence as are anywhere
to be found in our language.&mdash;<span class="smcap">J. Swift.</span> <i>A proposal

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span></p>


<h3>THE GRAND MINE OF DICTION</h3>

<p>... He [the translator of Homer] will find one English
book and one only, where, as in the <i>Iliad</i> itself, perfect
plainness of speech is allied with perfect nobleness; and
that book is the Bible. No one could see this more clearly
than Pope saw it: 'This pure and noble simplicity,' he
says, 'is nowhere in such perfection as in the Scripture and
Homer': yet even with Pope a woman is a 'fair', a father
is a 'sire', and an old man a 'reverend sage', and so on
through all the phrases of that pseudo-Augustan, and most
unbiblical, vocabulary. The Bible, however, is undoubtedly
the grand mine of diction for the translator of Homer;
and, if he knows how to discriminate truly between what
will suit him and what will not, the Bible may afford him
also invaluable lessons of style.&mdash;<span class="smcap">M. Arnold.</span> <i>On Translating
Homer.</i></p>


<h3>THE ENGLISH OF THE BIBLE</h3>

<p>Who will say that the uncommon beauty and marvellous
English of the Protestant Bible is not one of the great
strongholds of heresy in this country? It lives on in the
ear, like a music that never can be forgotten, like the
sound of church bells which the convert hardly knows how
he can forgo. Its felicities seem often to be almost things
rather than mere words. It is part of the national mind,
and the anchor of the national seriousness.... Nay, it is
worshipped with a positive idolatry, in extenuation of
whose grotesque fanaticism its intrinsic beauty pleads
availingly with the man of letters and the scholar. The
memory of the dead passes into it. The potent traditions
of childhood are stereotyped in its verses. The power of
all the griefs and trials of a man is hidden beneath its words.
It is the representative of his best moments, and all that
there has been about him of soft, and gentle, and pure,
and penitent, and good, speaks to him for ever out of his
English Bible. It is his sacred thing which doubt never
dimmed and controversy never soiled. In the length and
breadth of the land there is not a Protestant, with one
spark of religiousness about him, whose spiritual biography
is not his Saxon Bible.&mdash;<span class="smcap">F. W. Faber.</span> <i>The Interest and

<h3>THE BIBLE AND BURNS</h3>

<p>Search Scotland over, from the Pentland to the Solway,
and there is not a cottage-hut so poor and wretched as to
be without its Bible; and hardly one that, on the same
shelf, and next to it, does not treasure a Burns. Have the
people degenerated since their adoption of this new manual?
Has their attachment to the Book of Books declined? Are
their hearts less firmly bound, than were their fathers', to
the old faith and the old virtues? I believe he that knows
the most of the country will be the readiest to answer all
these questions, as every lover of genius and virtue would
desire to hear them answered.... Extraordinary ... has been
the unanimity of his critics. While differing widely in their
estimates of his character and <i>morale</i>, they have, without
a single exception, expressed a lofty idea of his powers of
mind and of the excellence of his poetry. Here, as on the
subject of Shakespeare, and on scarcely any other, have
Whigs and Tories, Infidels and Christians, bigoted Scotchmen
and bigoted sons of John Bull, the high and the low,
the rich and the poor, the prosaic and the enthusiastic
lovers of poetry, the strait-laced and the morally lax, met
and embraced each other.&mdash;<span class="smcap">J. G. Lockhart.</span> <i>Life of

<h3>'OF THE IMITATION OF CHRIST'</h3>

<p>She read on and on in the old book, devouring eagerly
the dialogues with the invisible Teacher, the pattern of
sorrow, the source of all strength; returning to it after she
had been called away, and reading till the sun went down
behind the willows. With all the hurry of an imagination
that could never rest in the present, she sat in the deepening
twilight forming plans of self-humiliation and entire
devotedness; and, in the ardour of first discovery, renunciation
seemed to her the entrance into that satisfaction which
she had so long been craving in vain. She had not perceived&mdash;how
could she until she had lived longer?&mdash;the
inmost truth of the old monk's outpourings, that renunciation
remains sorrow, though a sorrow borne willingly.
Maggie was still panting for happiness, and was in ecstasy
because she had found the key to it. She knew nothing
of doctrines and systems&mdash;of mysticism or quietism; but
this voice out of the far-off middle ages was the direct
communication of a human soul's belief and experience,
and came to Maggie as an unquestioned message.</p>

<p>I suppose that is the reason why the small old-fashioned
book, for which you need only pay sixpence at a bookstall,
works miracles to this day, turning bitter waters into
sweetness; while expensive sermons and treatises, newly
issued, leave all things as they were before. It was written
down by a hand that waited for the heart's prompting;
it is the chronicle of a solitary, hidden anguish, struggle,
trust and triumph&mdash;not written on velvet cushions to teach
endurance to those who are treading with bleeding feet on
the stones. And so it remains to all time a lasting record
of human needs and human consolations: the voice of
a brother who, ages ago, felt and suffered and renounced&mdash;in
the cloister, perhaps, with serge gown and tonsured head,
with much chanting and long fasts, and with a fashion of
speech different from ours&mdash;but under the same silent
far-off heavens, and with the same passionate desires, the
same strivings, the same failures, the same weariness.&mdash;<span class="smcap">G.

<h3>LITERARY GEOGRAPHY</h3>

<p><i>Scotland.</i></p>

<p>The globe we inhabit is divisible into two worlds; one
hardly less tangible, and far more known than the other,&mdash;the
common geographical world, and the world of books;
and the latter may be as geographically set forth. A man
of letters, conversant with poetry and romance, might draw
out a very curious map, in which this world of books should
be delineated and filled up, to the delight of all genuine
readers, as truly as that in Guthrie or Pinkerton. To give
a specimen, and begin with Scotland,&mdash;Scotland would not
be the mere territory it is, with a scale of so many miles
to a degree, and such and such a population. Who (except
a patriot or cosmopolite) cares for the miles or the men,
or knows that they exist, in any degree of consciousness
with which he cares for the never-dying population of
books? How many generations of men have passed away,
and will pass, in Ayrshire or Dumfries, and not all the
myriads be as interesting to us as a single Burns? What
have we known of them, or shall ever know, whether lairds,
lords, or ladies, in comparison with the inspired ploughman?
But we know of the bards and the lasses, and
the places which he has recorded in song; we know
the scene of 'Tam o' Shanter's' exploit; we know the
pastoral landscapes ... and the scenes immortalized in
Walter Scott and the old ballads; and, therefore, the
book-map of Scotland would present us with the most
prominent of these. We should have the Border, with its
banditti, towns, and woods; Tweedside, Melrose, and
Roslin, 'Edina,' otherwise called Edinburgh and Auld
Reekie, or the town of Hume, Robertson, and others;
Woodhouselee, and other classical and haunted places; the
bower built by the fair hands of 'Bessie Bell' and 'Mary
Gray'; the farm-houses of Burns's friends; the scenes of
his loves and sorrows; the land of 'Old Mortality', of
the 'Gentle Shepherd', and of 'Ossian'. The Highlands,
and the great blue billowy domains of heather, would be
distinctly marked out, in their most poetical regions; and
we should have the tracks of Ben Jonson to Hawthornden,
of 'Rob Roy' to his hiding-places, and of 'Jeanie Deans'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
towards England. Abbotsford, be sure, would not be left
out; nor the house of the 'Antiquary'&mdash;almost as real
a man as his author. Nor is this all: for we should have
older Scotland, the Scotland of James the First, and of
'Peeblis at the Play', and Gawin Douglas, and Bruce, and
Wallace; we should have older Scotland still, the Scotland
of Ariosto, with his tale of 'Ginevra', and the new 'Andromeda',
delivered from the sea-monster at the Isle of
Ebuda (the Hebrides); and there would be the residence
of the famous 'Launcelot of the Lake', at Berwick, called
the Joyeuse Garde, and other ancient sites of chivalry
and romance; nor should the nightingale be left out in
'Ginevra's' bower, for Ariosto has put it there, and there,
accordingly, it is and has been heard, let ornithology say
what it will; for what ornithologist knows so much of the
nightingale as a poet? We would have an inscription put
on the spot&mdash;'Here the nightingale sings, contrary to what
has been affirmed by White and others.' This is the Scotland
of books, and a beautiful place it is. I will venture
to affirm, Sir, even to yourself, that it is a more beautiful
place than the other Scotland, always excepting to an exile
or a lover.</p>


<p><i>England.</i></p>

<p>Book-England, on the map, would shine as the Albion
of the old Giants; as the 'Logres' of the Knights of the
Round Table; as the scene of Amadis of Gaul, with its
<i>island</i> of Windsor; as the abode of fairies, of the Druids,
of the divine Countess of Coventry, of Guy, Earl of Warwick,
of 'Alfred' (whose reality was a romance), of the Fair
Rosamond, of the <i>Arcades</i> and <i>Comus</i>, of Chaucer and
Spenser, of the poets of the Globe and the Mermaid, the
wits of Twickenham and Hampton Court. Fleet Street
would be Johnson's Fleet Street; the Tower would belong
to Julius Caesar; and Blackfriars to Suckling, Vandyke,
and the <i>Dunciad</i>. Chronology and the mixture of truth
and fiction, that is to say, of one sort of truth and another,
would come to nothing in a work of this kind; for, as it
has been before observed, things are real in proportion as
they are impressive. And who has not as 'gross, open,
and palpable' an idea of 'Falstaff' in Eastcheap, as of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
'Captain Grose' himself, beating up his quarters? A map
of fictitious, literary, and historical London, would, of itself,
constitute a great curiosity.</p>


<p><i>Ireland.</i></p>

<p>Swift speaks of maps, in which they</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">Place elephants for want of towns.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Here would be towns and elephants too, the popular and
the prodigious. How much would not Swift do for Ireland,
in this geography of wit and talent! What a figure would
not St. Patrick's Cathedral make! The other day, mention
was made of a 'Dean of St. Patrick's' <i>now living</i>; as if
there was, or ever could be, more than one Dean of
St. Patrick's! In the Irish maps we should have the Saint
himself driving out all venomous creatures (what a pity
that the most venomous retain a property as absentees!);
and there would be the old Irish kings, and O'Donoghue
with his White Horse, and the lady of the 'gold wand'
who made the miraculous virgin pilgrimage, and all the
other marvels of lakes and ladies, and the Round Towers
still remaining to perplex the antiquary, and Goldsmith's
'Deserted Village', and Goldsmith himself, and the birthplaces
of Steele and Sterne, and the brief hour of poor
Lord Edward Fitzgerald, and Carolan with his harp, and
the schools of the poor Latin boys under the hedges, and
Castle Rackrent, and Edgeworth's-town, and the Giant's
Causeway, and Ginleas and other classical poverties, and
Spenser's castle on the river Mulla, with the wood-gods
whom his pipe drew round him.&mdash;<span class="smcap">J. H. Leigh Hunt.</span> <i>The

<h3>BOOKS FOR THE SALON</h3>

<p>I am sure that if Madame de Sablé lived now, books
would be seen in her salon as part of its natural indispensable
furniture; not brought out, and strewed here and
there when 'company was coming', but as habitual presences
in her room, wanting which, she would want a sense
of warmth and comfort and companionship. Putting out
books as a sort of preparation for an evening, as a means
for making it pass agreeably, is running a great risk. In
the first place, books are by such people, and on such
occasions, chosen more for their outside than their inside.
And in the next, they are the 'mere material with which
wisdom (or wit) builds'; and if persons don't know how
to use the material, they will suggest nothing. I imagine
Madame de Sablé would have the volumes she herself was
reading, or those which, being new, contained any matter
of present interest, left about, as they would naturally be.
I could also fancy that her guests would not feel bound
to talk continually, whether they had anything to say or
not, but that there might be pauses of not unpleasant
silence&mdash;a quiet darkness out of which they might be certain
that the little stars would glimmer soon. I can believe
that in such pauses of repose, some one might open a book,
and catch on a suggestive sentence, might dash off again
into a full flow of conversation. But I cannot fancy any
grand preparations for what was to be said among people,
each of whom brought the best dish in bringing himself;
and whose own store of living, individual thought and
feeling, and mother-wit, would be infinitely better than any
cut-and-dry determination to devote the evening to mutual
improvement. If people are really good and wise, their
goodness and their wisdom flow out unconsciously, and
benefit like sunlight. So, books for reference, books for
impromptu suggestion, but never books to serve for texts
to a lecture.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Elizabeth C. Gaskell.</span> <i>Company Manners.</i><br /><br /></p>

<h3>THE LIBRARY AS STUDY</h3>

<p>I like a great library next my study; but for the study
itself, give me a small snug place, almost entirely walled
with books. There should be only one window in it, looking
upon trees. Some prefer a place with few, or no books at
all&mdash;nothing but a chair or a table, like Epictetus; but
I should say that these were philosophers, not lovers of
books, if I did not recollect that Montaigne was both. He
had a study in a round tower, walled as aforesaid. It is
true, one forgets one's books while writing&mdash;at least they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
say so. For my part, I think I have them in a sort of sidelong
mind's eye; like a second thought, which is none&mdash;like
a waterfall, or a whispering wind.</p>

<p>I dislike a grand library to study in. I mean an immense
apartment, with books all in Museum order, especially
wire-safed. I say nothing against the Museum itself, or
public libraries. They are capital places to go to, but not
to sit in; and talking of this, I hate to read in public, and
in strange company. The jealous silence; the dissatisfied
looks of the messengers; the inability to help yourself;
the not knowing whether you really ought to trouble the
messengers, much less the Gentleman in black, or brown,
who is, perhaps, half a trustee; with a variety of other
jarrings between privacy and publicity, prevent one's
settling heartily to work.... A grand private library, which
the master of the house also makes his study, never looks
to me like a real place of books, much less of authorship.
I cannot take kindly to it. It is certainly not out of envy;
for three parts of the books are generally trash, and I can
seldom think of the rest and the proprietor together. It
reminds me of a fine gentleman, of a collector, of a patron,
of Gil Blas and the Marquis of Marialva; of anything but
genius and comfort. I have a particular hatred of a round
table (not <i>the</i> Round Table, for that was a dining one)
covered and irradiated with books, and never met with one
in the house of a clever man but once. It is the reverse of
Montaigne's Round Tower. Instead of bringing the books
around you, they all seem turning another way, and eluding
your hands.</p>

<p>Conscious of my propriety and comfort in these matters,
I take an interest in the bookcases as well as the books of
my friends. I long to meddle and dispose them after my
own notions.&mdash;<span class="smcap">J. H. Leigh Hunt.</span> <i>My Books.</i><br /><br /></p>

<h3>THE CONSULTING ROOM OF A WISE MAN</h3>

<p>The great consulting room of a wise man is a library.
When I am in perplexity about life, I have but to come
here, and, without fee or reward, I commune with the
wisest souls that God has blessed the world with. If I want
a discourse on immortality Plato comes to my help. If
I want to know the human heart Shakespeare opens all
its chambers. Whatever be my perplexity or doubt, I know
exactly the great man to call to me, and he comes in the
kindest way, he listens to my doubts and tells me his convictions.
So that a library may be regarded as the solemn
chamber in which a man can take counsel with all that
have been wise and great and good and glorious amongst
the men that have gone before him. If we come down for
a moment and look at the bare and immediate utilities of
a library we find that here a man gets himself ready for
his calling, arms himself for his profession, finds out the
facts that are to determine his trade, prepares himself for
his examination. The utilities of it are endless and priceless.
It is too a place of pastime; for man has no amusement
more innocent, more sweet, more gracious, more
elevating, and more fortifying than he can find in a library.&mdash;<span class="smcap">George
Dawson.</span> <i>Address at the opening of the Birmingham
Free Reference Library</i>, 1866.</p>


<h3>THE LIBRARY A KEY TO CHARACTER</h3>

<p>The first thing, naturally, when one enters a scholar's
study or library, is to look at his books. One gets a notion
very speedily of his tastes and the range of his pursuits
by a glance round his bookshelves.</p>

<p>Of course, you know there are many fine houses where
a library is a part of the upholstery, so to speak. Books
in handsome binding kept locked under plate-glass in
showy dwarf bookcases are as important to stylish establishments
as servants in livery, who sit with folded arms,
are to stylish equipages. I suppose those wonderful statues
with the folded arms do sometimes change their attitude,
and I suppose those books with the gilded backs do sometimes
get opened, but it is nobody's business whether they
do or not, and it is best not to ask too many questions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span></p>

<p>This sort of thing is common enough, but there is another
case that may prove deceptive if you undertake to judge
from appearances. Once in a while you will come on a house
where you will find a family of readers and almost no
library. Some of the most indefatigable devourers of
literature have very few books. They belong to book
clubs, they haunt the public libraries, they borrow of
friends, and somehow or other get hold of everything they
want, scoop out all it holds for them, and have done with it.&mdash;<span class="smcap">O.
W. Holmes.</span> <i>The Poet at the Breakfast-Table.</i></p>


<h3>THE SCENT OF BOOKS</h3>

<p>I know men who say they had as lief read any book in
a library copy as in one from their own shelf. To me that
is unintelligible. For one thing, I know every book of mine
by its <i>scent</i>, and I have but to put my nose between the
pages to be reminded of all sorts of things. My Gibbon,
for example, my well-bound eight-volume Milman edition,
which I have read and read and read again for more than
thirty years&mdash;never do I open it but the scent of the noble
pages restores to me all the exultant happiness of that
moment when I received it as a prize. Or my Shakespeare,
the great Cambridge Shakespeare&mdash;it has an odour which
carries me yet further back in life; for these volumes
belonged to my father, and before I was old enough to
read them with understanding, it was often permitted me,
as a treat, to take down one of them from the bookcase,
and reverently to turn the leaves. The volumes smell
exactly as they did in that old time, and what a strange
tenderness comes upon me when I hold one of them in hand.
For that reason I do not often read Shakespeare in
this edition.&mdash;<span class="smcap">G. Gissing.</span> <i>The Private Papers of Henry

<h3>MR. SHANDY'S LIBRARY</h3>

<p>Few men of great genius had exercised their parts in
writing books upon the subject of great noses: by the
trotting of my lean horse, the thing is incredible! and I am
quite lost in my understanding, when I am considering
what a treasure of precious time and talents together has
been wasted upon worse subjects&mdash;and how many millions
of books in all languages, and in all possible types and
bindings, have been fabricated upon points not half so
much tending to the unity and peace-making of the world.
What was to be had, however, he set the greater store by;
and though my father would ofttimes sport with my uncle
Toby's library&mdash;which, by the by, was ridiculous enough&mdash;yet
at the very same time he did it, he collected every book
and treatise which had been systematically wrote upon
noses, with as much care as my honest uncle Toby had
done those upon military architecture.... My father's collection
was not great, but, to make amends, it was curious;
and consequently he was some time in making it ... he got
hold of Prignitz&mdash;purchased Scroderus, Andrea Paraeus,
Bouchet's Evening Conferences, and above all, the great and
learned Hafen Slawkenbergius.... To do justice to Slawkenbergius,
he has entered the list with a stronger lance, and
taken a much larger career in it than any one man who
had ever entered it before him&mdash;and indeed, in many
respects, deserves to be en-niched as a prototype for all
writers, of voluminous works at least, to model their books
by&mdash;for he has taken in, Sir, the whole subject&mdash;examined
every part of it dialectically&mdash;&mdash;then brought it into full day;
dilucidating it with all the light which either the collision
of his own natural parts could strike&mdash;or the profoundest
knowledge of the sciences had empowered him to cast upon
it&mdash;collating, collecting, and compiling&mdash;begging, borrowing,
and stealing, as he went along, all that had been wrote
or wrangled thereupon in the schools and porticoes of the
learned: so that Slawkenbergius his book may properly
be considered, not only as a model&mdash;but as a thorough-stitched
digest and regular institute of noses, comprehending
in it all that is or can be needful to be known about
them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span></p>

<p>For this cause it is that I forbear to speak of so many
(otherwise) valuable books and treatises of my father's
collecting, wrote either, plump upon noses&mdash;or collaterally
touching them;&mdash;&mdash;such for instance as Prignitz, now lying
upon the table before me, who with infinite learning, and
from the most candid and scholar-like examination of above
four thousand different skulls, in upwards of twenty charnel-houses
in Silesia, which he had rummaged&mdash;&mdash;has informed
us, that the mensuration and configuration of the osseous or
bony parts of human noses, in any given tract of country,
except Crim Tartary, where they are all crushed down by
the thumb, so that no judgement can be formed upon
them&mdash;are much nearer alike, than the world imagines.&mdash;<span class="smcap">L.
Sterne.</span> <i>Tristram Shandy.</i></p>


<h3>DOMINIE SAMPSON IN THE LIBRARY</h3>

<p>Dominie Sampson was occupied, body and soul, in the
arrangement of the late bishop's library, which had been
sent from Liverpool by sea, and conveyed by thirty or
forty carts from the seaport at which it was landed. Sampson's
joy at beholding the ponderous contents of these
chests arranged upon the floor of the large apartment,
from whence he was to transfer them to the shelves, baffles
all description. He grinned like an ogre, swung his arms
like the sails of a windmill, shouted 'Prodigious' till the
roof rung to his raptures. 'He had never,' he said, 'seen
so many books together, except in the College Library;'
and now his dignity and delight in being superintendent
of the collection, raised him, in his own opinion, almost
to the rank of the academical librarian, whom he had always
regarded as the greatest and happiest man on earth. Neither
were his transports diminished upon a hasty examination
of the contents of these volumes. Some, indeed, of belles
lettres, poems, plays, or memoirs, he tossed indignantly
aside, with the implied censure of 'psha', or 'frivolous';
but the greater and bulkier part of the collection bore
a very different character. The deceased prelate, a
divine of the old and deeply-learned cast, had loaded
his shelves with volumes which displayed the antique<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
and venerable attributes so happily described by a
modern poet:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">That weight of wood, with leathern coat o'erlaid;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Those ample clasps, of solid metal made;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The close-pressed leaves unoped for many an age;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The dull red edging of the well-filled page;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">On the broad back the stubborn ridges rolled,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Where yet the title stands in tarnished gold.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Books of theology and controversial divinity, commentaries,
and polyglots, sets of the Fathers, and sermons,
which might each furnish forth ten brief discourses of
modern date, books of science, ancient and modern, classical
authors in their best and rarest forms; such formed the
late bishop's venerable library, and over such the eye of
Dominie Sampson gloated with rapture. He entered them
in the catalogue in his best running hand, forming each
letter with the accuracy of a lover writing a valentine, and
placed each individually on the destined shelf with all the
reverence which I have seen a lady pay to a jar of old china.
With all this zeal his labours advanced slowly. He often
opened a volume when half-way up the library-steps, fell
upon some interesting passage, and, without shifting his
inconvenient posture, continued immersed in the fascinating
perusal until the servant pulled him by the skirts to assure
him that dinner waited. He then repaired to the parlour,
bolted his food down his capacious throat in squares of three
inches, answered aye or no at random to whatever question
was asked at him, and again hurried back to the library as
soon as his napkin was removed, and sometimes with it
hanging round his neck like a pinafore&mdash;<br /><br /></p>

<h3>MONTAIGNE'S LIBRARY</h3>

<p>At home I betake me somewhat the oftener to my library,
whence all at once I command and survey all my household.
It is seated in the chief entry of my house, thence I behold
under me my garden, my base court, my yard, and look
even into most rooms of my house. There without order,
without method, and by piece-meals I turn over and ransack,
now one book and now another. Sometimes I muse
and rave; and walking up and down I indite and enregister
these my humours, these my conceits. It is placed
on the third story of a tower. The lowermost is my
chapel; the second a chamber with other lodgings, where
I often lie, because I would be alone. Above it is a great
wardrobe. It was in times past the most unprofitable place
of all my house. There I pass the greatest part of my
life's days, and wear out most hours of the day. I am never
there a nights. Next unto it is a handsome neat cabinet,
able and large enough to receive fire in winter, and very
pleasantly windowen. And if I feared not care more than
cost (care which drives and diverts me from all business),
I might easily join a convenient gallery of a hundred paces
long and twelve broad on each side of it, and upon one
floor; having already, for some other purpose, found all
the walls raised unto a convenient height. Each retired
place requireth a walk. My thoughts are prone to sleep
if I sit long. My mind goes not alone, as if ledges did move
it. Those that study without books are all in the same case.
The form of it is round, and hath no flat side, but what
serveth for my table and chair: in which bending or
circling manner, at one look it offereth me the full sight of
all my books, set round about upon shelves or desks, five
ranks one upon another. It hath three bay-windows, of
a far-extending, rich and unresisted prospect, and is in
diameter sixteen paces void. In winter I am less continually
there: for my house (as the name of it importeth) is
perched upon an over-peering hillock; and hath no part
more subject to all weathers than this: which pleaseth me
the more, both because the access unto it is somewhat
troublesome and remote, and for the benefit of the exercise
which is to be respected; and that I may the better seclude<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
myself from company, and keep encroachers from me:
There is my seat, that is my throne. I endeavour to make
my rule therein absolute, and to sequester that only corner
from the community of wife, of children, and of acquaintance.
Elsewhere I have but a verbal authority, of confused
essence. Miserable in my mind is he who in his own
home hath nowhere to be to himself; where he may particularly
court, and at his pleasure hide or withdraw self.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Montaigne.</span></p>


<h3>A COLLOQUY IN A LIBRARY</h3>

<p>I was in my library, making room upon the shelves for
some books which had just arrived from New England,
removing to a less conspicuous station others which were
of less value and in worse dress, when Sir Thomas entered.
You are employed, said he, to your heart's content. Why,
Montesinos, with these books, and the delight you take in
their constant society, what have you to covet or desire?</p>

<p><i>Montesinos</i></p>

<p>Nothing, ... except more books.</p>

<p><i>Sir Thomas More</i></p>

<p>Crescit, indulgens sibi, dirus hydrops.</p>

<p><i>Montesinos</i></p>

<p>Nay, nay, my ghostly monitor, this at least is no diseased
desire! If I covet more, it is for the want I feel and the
use which I should make of them.</p>

<p>'Libraries,' says my good old friend George Dyer,
a man as learned as he is benevolent, ... 'libraries are the
wardrobes of literature, whence men, properly informed,
might bring forth something for ornament, much for
curiosity, and more for use.' These books of mine, as you
well know, are not drawn up here for display, however
much the pride of the eye may be gratified in beholding
them; they are on actual service. Whenever they may be
dispersed, there is not one among them that will ever
be more comfortably lodged, or more highly prized by its
possessor; and generations may pass away before some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
of them will again find a reader.... It is well that we do
not moralize too much upon such subjects, ...</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">For foresight is a melancholy gift,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Which bares the bald, and speeds the all-too-swift.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But the dispersion of a library, whether in retrospect or
in anticipation, is always to me a melancholy thing.</p>

<p><i>Sir Thomas More</i></p>

<p>How many such dispersions must have taken place to have
made it possible that these books should thus be brought
together here among the Cumberland mountains!</p>

<p><i>Montesinos</i></p>

<p>Many, indeed; and in many instances most disastrous
ones. Not a few of these volumes have been cast up from
the wreck of the family or convent libraries during the late
Revolution. Yonder Acta Sanctorum belonged to the Capuchines,
at Ghent. This book of St. Bridget's Revelations,
in which not only all the initial letters are illuminated,
but every capital throughout the volume was coloured,
came from the Carmelite Nunnery at Bruges. That copy
of Alain Chartier, from the Jesuits' College at Louvain;
that <i>Imago Primi Saeculi Societatis</i>, from their college at
Ruremond. Here are books from Colbert's library; here
others from the Lamoignon one.... A book is the more
valuable to me when I know to whom it has belonged,
and through what 'scenes and changes' it has past.</p>

<p><i>Sir Thomas More</i></p>

<p>You would have its history recorded in the fly-leaf, as
carefully as the pedigree of a race-horse is preserved.</p>

<p><i>Montesinos</i></p>

<p>I confess that I have much of that feeling in which the
superstition concerning relics has originated; and I am
sorry when I see the name of a former owner obliterated in
a book, or the plate of his arms defaced. Poor memorials
though they be, yet they are something saved for awhile
from oblivion; and I should be almost as unwilling to destroy
them, as to efface the <i>Hic jacet</i> of a tombstone. There may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
be sometimes a pleasure in recognizing them, sometimes
a salutary sadness....</p>

<p><i>Sir Thomas More</i></p>

<p>How peaceably they stand together,&mdash;Papists and Protestants
side by side!</p>

<p><i>Montesinos</i></p>

<p>Their very dust reposes not more quietly in the cemetery.
Ancient and Modern, Jew and Gentile, Mahommedan and
Crusader, French and English, Spaniards and Portuguese,
Dutch and Brazilians, fighting their old battles, silently
now, upon the same shelf: Fernand Lopez and Pedro de
Ayala; John de Laet and Barlaeus, with the historians of
Joam Fernandes Vieira; Foxe's Martyrs and the Three
Conversions of Father Parsons; Cranmer and Stephen
Gardiner; Dominican and Franciscan; Jesuit and <i>Philosophe</i>
(equally misnamed); Churchmen and Sectarians;
Roundheads and Cavaliers!</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">Here are God's conduits, grave divines; and here<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Is nature's secretary, the philosopher:<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And wily statesman, which teach how to tie<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The sinews of a city's mystic body;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Here gathering chroniclers: and by them stand<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Giddy fantastic poets of each land.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Here I possess these gathered treasures of time, the harvest
of so many generations, laid up in my garners: and when
I go to the window, there is the lake, and the circle of the
mountains, and the illimitable sky.... Never can any man's
life have been passed more in accord with his own inclinations,
nor more answerably to his own desires. Excepting
that peace which, through God's infinite mercy, is derived
from a higher source, it is to literature, humanly speaking,
that I am beholden, not only for the means of subsistence,
but for every blessing which I enjoy; ... health of mind
and activity of mind, contentment, cheerfulness, continual
employments, and therewith continual pleasure. <i>Suavissima
vita indies sentire se fieri meliorem</i>; and this, as Bacon
has said, and Clarendon repeated, is the benefit that a
studious man enjoys in retirement. To the studies which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
I have faithfully pursued, I am indebted for friends with
whom, hereafter, it will be deemed an honour to have lived
in friendship; and as for the enemies which they have
procured to me in sufficient numbers, ... happily I am not
of the thin-skinned race, ... they might as well fire small
shot at a rhinoceros, as direct their attacks upon me.
<i>In omnibus requiem quaesivi</i>, said Thomas à Kempis, <i>sed
non inveni nisi in angulis et libellis</i>. I too have found repose
where he did, in books and retirement, but it was there
alone I sought it: to these my nature, under the direction
of a merciful Providence, led me betimes, and the world
can offer nothing which should tempt me from them.&mdash;<span class="smcap">R.
Southey.</span> <i>Sir Thomas More: or, Colloquies on the
Progress and Prospects of Society. Colloquy xiv: 'The
Library.'</i></p>


<h3>CHARLES LAMB'S LIBRARY</h3>

<p>His library, though not abounding in Greek or Latin
(which are the only things to help some persons to an
idea of literature), is anything but superficial. The depths
of philosophy and poetry are there, the innermost passages
of the human heart. It has some Latin too. It has also
a handsome contempt for appearance. It looks like what
it is, a selection made at precious intervals from the book-stalls;
now a Chaucer at nine and twopence; now a Montaigne
or a Sir Thomas Browne at two shillings; now
a Jeremy Taylor; a Spinoza; an old English Dramatist,
Prior, and Sir Philip Sidney; and the books are 'neat as
imported'. The very perusal of the backs is a 'discipline
of humanity'. There Mr. Southey takes his place again
with an old Radical friend: there Jeremy Collier is at
peace with Dryden: there the lion, Martin Luther, lies
down with the Quaker lamb, Sewell: there Guzman
d'Alfarache thinks himself fit company for Sir Charles
Grandison, and has his claims admitted. Even the 'high
fantastical' Duchess of Newcastle, with her laurel on her
head, is received with grave honours, and not the less for
declining to trouble herself with the constitutions of her
maids.&mdash;<span class="smcap">J. H. Leigh Hunt.</span> <i>My Books.</i></p>

<h3>THE SHRINES OF THE ANCIENT SAINTS</h3>

<p>The works or acts of merit towards learning are conversant
about three objects; the places of learning, the
books of learning, and the persons of the learned.... The
works touching books are two: first, libraries which are
as the shrines where all the relics of the ancient saints,
full of true virtue, and that without delusion or imposture,
are preserved and reposed; secondly, new editions of
authors, with more correct impressions, more faithful translations,
more profitable glosses, more diligent annotations,
and the like.&mdash;<span class="smcap">F. Bacon, Lord Verulam.</span> <i>Of the Advancement
of Learning.</i></p>


<h3>A MOST HORRIBLE INFAMY</h3>

<p>Never had we been offended for the loss of our libraries,
being so many in number, and in so desolate places for
the most part, if the chief monuments and most notable
works of our excellent writers had been reserved. If there
had been in every shire of England but one Solempne
Library, to the preservation of those noble works, and
preferment of good learning in our posterity, it had been
yet somewhat. But to destroy all without consideration
is, and will be, unto England for ever, a most horrible
infamy among the grave seniors of other nations. A great
number of them which purchased those superstitious mansions,
reserved of those library-books, some to serve the
jakes, some to scour their candlesticks, and some to rub
their boots. Some they sold to the grocers and soap-sellers;
some they sent over sea to the bookbinders, not in small
number, but at times whole ships full, to the wondering
of the foreign nations. Yea, the universities of this realm
are not all clear of this detestable fact. But, cursed is
that belly which seeketh to be fed with such ungodly gains,
and shameth his natural country. I know a merchant-man,
which shall at this time be nameless, that bought
the contents of two noble libraries for forty shillings price;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
a shame it is to be spoken! This stuff hath he occupied
in the stead of gray paper, by the space of more than ten
years, and yet he hath store enough for as many years to
come!&mdash;<span class="smcap">J. Bale.</span> <i>Preface to the Laboryouse Journey of

<h3>LIBRARIES FOR EVERY CITY</h3>

<p>I hope it will not be long before royal or national libraries
will be founded in every considerable city, with a royal
series of books in them; the same series in every one of
them, chosen books, the best in every kind, prepared for
that national series in the most perfect way possible;
their text printed all on leaves of equal size, broad of
margin, and divided into pleasant volumes, light in the
hand, beautiful, and strong, and thorough as examples of
binders' work; and that these great libraries will be
accessible to all clean and orderly persons at all times of
the day and evening; strict law being enforced for this
cleanliness and quietness.&mdash;<span class="smcap">J. Ruskin.</span> <i>Sesame and Lilies.</i></p>

<h3>THE REFERENCE LIBRARY</h3>

<p>One of the great offices of a Reference Library is to keep
at the service of everybody what everybody cannot keep
at home for his own service. It is not convenient to every
man to have a very large telescope; I may wish to study
the skeleton of a whale but my house is not large enough
to hold one; I may be curious in microscopes but I may
have no money to buy one of my own. But provide an
institution like this and here is the telescope, here is the
microscope, and here the skeleton of the whale. Here are
the great picture, the mighty book, the ponderous atlas,
the great histories of the world. They are here always
ready for the use of every man without his being put to
the cost of purchase or the discomfort of giving them house-room.
Here are books that we only want to consult occasionally
and which are very costly. These are the books<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
proper for a Library like this&mdash;mighty cyclopaedias, prodigious
charts, books that only Governments can publish.
It is almost the only place where I would avoid cheapness
as a plague and run away from mean printing and petty
pages with disgust.&mdash;<span class="smcap">George Dawson.</span> <i>Address at the
opening of the Birmingham Free Reference Library</i>, 1866.</p>


<h3>IN THE BRITISH MUSEUM LIBRARY</h3>

<p>The shade deepens as I turn from the portico to the hall
and vast domed house of books. The half-hearted light
under the dome is stagnant and dead. For it is the nature
of light to beat and throb; it has a pulse and undulation
like the swing of the sea. Under the trees in the woodlands
it vibrates and lives; on the hills there is a resonance of
light.... It is renewed and fresh every moment, and never
twice do you see the same ray. Stayed and checked by the
dome and book-built walls, the beams lose their elasticity,
and the ripple ceases in the motionless pool. The eyes,
responding, forget to turn quickly, and only partially see.
Deeper thought and inspiration quit the heart, for they can
only exist where the light vibrates and communicates its
tone to the soul. If any imagine they shall find thought in
many books, certainly they will be disappointed. Thought
dwells by the stream and sea, by the hill and in the woodland,
in the sunlight and free wind, where the wild dove
haunts. Walls and roof shut it off as they shut off the
undulation of light. The very lightning cannot penetrate
here. A murkiness marks the coming of the cloud, and
the dome becomes vague, but the fierce flash is shorn to
a pale reflection, and the thunder is no more than the rolling
of a heavier truck loaded with tomes. But in closing out
the sky, with it is cut off all that the sky can tell you with
its light, or in its passion of storm.</p>

<p>Sitting at these long desks and trying to read, I soon find
that I have made a mistake; it is not here I shall find that
which I seek. Yet the magic of books draws me here time
after time, to be as often disappointed. Something in
a book tempts the mind as pictures tempt the eye; the eye
grows weary of pictures, but looks again. The mind wearies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
of books, yet cannot forget that once when they were first
opened in youth they gave it hope of knowledge. Those
first books exhausted, there is nothing left but words and
covers. It seems as if all the books in the world&mdash;really
books&mdash;can be bought for £10. Man's whole thought is
purchaseable at that small price, for the value of a watch,
of a good dog. For the rest it is repetition and paraphrase.&mdash;<span class="smcap">R.
Jefferies.</span> <i>The Life of the Fields: The Pigeons at the
British Museum.</i></p>


<h3>THE LIBRARY AN HERACLEA</h3>

<p>Now behold us, ... settled in all the state and grandeur
of our own house in Russell Street, Bloomsbury: the
library of the Museum close at hand. My father spends
his mornings in those <i>lata silentia</i>, as Virgil calls the world
beyond the grave. And a world beyond the grave we may
well call that land of the ghosts, a book collection.</p>

<p>'Pisistratus,' said my father, one evening as he arranged
his notes before him, and rubbed his spectacles. 'Pisistratus,
a great library is an <i>awful</i> place! There, are interred
all the remains of men since the Flood.'</p>

<p>'It is a burial-place!' quoth my Uncle Roland, who had
that day found us out.</p>

<p>'It is an Heraclea!' said my father.</p>

<p>'Please, not such hard words,' said the Captain, shaking
his head.</p>

<p>'Heraclea was the city of necromancers, in which they
raised the dead. Do I want to speak to Cicero?&mdash;I invoke
him. Do I want to chat in the Athenian market-place, and
hear news two thousand years old?&mdash;I write down my
charm on a slip of paper, and a grave magician calls me
up Aristophanes.... But it is not <i>that</i> which is awful. It is
the presuming to vie with these "spirits elect": to say
to them, "Make way&mdash;I too claim place with the chosen.
I too would confer with the living, centuries after the death
that consumes my dust."'&mdash;<span class="smcap">E. G. E. L. Bulwer-Lytton,
Lord Lytton.</span> <i>The Caxtons.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span></p>


<h3>BOOKS IN A NEW LIGHT</h3>

<p>I should explain that I cannot write unless I have
a sloping desk, and the reading-room of the British Museum,
where alone I can compose freely, is unprovided with sloping
desks. Like every other organism, if I cannot get exactly
what I want, I make shift with the next thing to it; true,
there are no desks in the reading-room, but, as I once heard
a visitor from the country say, 'it contains a large number
of very interesting works.' I know it was not right, and
hope the Museum authorities will not be severe upon me
if any one of them reads this confession; but I wanted
a desk, and set myself to consider which of the many very
interesting works which a grateful nation places at the
disposal of its would-be authors was best suited for my
purpose.</p>

<p>For mere reading I suppose one book is pretty much as
good as another: but the choice of a desk-book is a more
serious matter. It must be neither too thick nor too thin;
it must be large enough to make a substantial support; it
must be strongly bound so as not to yield or give; it must
not be too troublesome to carry backwards and forwards;
and it must live on shelf C, D, or E, so that there need be
no stooping or reaching too high.... For weeks I made
experiments upon sundry poetical and philosophical works,
whose names I have forgotten, but could not succeed in
finding my ideal desk, until at length, more by luck than
cunning, I happened to light upon Frost's '<i>Lives of Eminent
Christians</i>', which I had no sooner tried than I discovered
it to be the very perfection and <i>ne plus ultra</i> of everything
that a book should be.... On finding myself asked for
a contribution to the <i>Universal Review</i>, I went, as I have
explained, to the Museum, and presently repaired to bookcase
No. 2008 to get my favourite volume. Alas! it was
in the room no longer. It was not in use, for its place was
filled up already; besides, no one ever used it but myself....
Till I have found a substitute I can write no more, and I do
not know how to find even a tolerable one. I should try
a volume of Migne's <i>Complete Course of Patrology</i>, but I do
not like books in more than one volume, for the volumes
vary in thickness, and one never can remember which one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
took; the four volumes, however, of Bede in Giles's <i>Anglican
Fathers</i> are not open to this objection, and I have reserved
them for favourable consideration. Mather's <i>Magnalia</i>
might do, but the binding does not please me; Cureton's
<i>Corpus Ignatianum</i> might also do if it were not too thin.
I do not like taking Norton's <i>Genuineness of the Gospels</i>,
as it is just possible some one may be wanting to know
whether the Gospels are genuine or not, and be unable to
find out because I have got Mr. Norton's book. Baxter's
<i>Church History of England</i>, Lingard's <i>Anglo-Saxon Church</i>,
and Cardwell's <i>Documentary Annals</i>, though none of them
as good as Frost, are works of considerable merit; but
on the whole I think Arvine's <i>Cyclopaedia of Moral and
Religious Anecdote</i> is perhaps the one book in the room
which comes within measurable distance of Frost.... Some
successor I must find, or I must give up writing altogether,
and this I should be sorry to do.&mdash;<span class="smcap">S. Butler.</span> <i>Essays on
Life, Art, and Science.</i></p>


<h3>ON THE SIGHT OF A GREAT LIBRARY</h3>

<p>What a world of wit is here packed up together! I know
not, whether this sight doth more dismay, or comfort me:
it dismays me, to think that here is so much that I cannot
know; it comforts me, to think that this variety yields so
good helps, to know what I should. There is no truer
word than that of Solomon: 'There is no end of making
many books.' This sight verifies it. There is no end: it
were pity there should. God hath given to man a busy
soul; the agitation whereof cannot but, through time and
experience, work out many hidden truths: to suppress
these, would be no other than injurious to mankind, whose
minds like unto so many candles should be kindled by
each other. The thoughts of our deliberation are most
accurate: these we vent into our papers. What a happiness
is it, that, without all offence of necromancy, I may
here call up any of the ancient worthies of learning, whether
human or divine, and confer with them of all my doubts!
that I can, at pleasure, summon whole synods of reverend
fathers and acute doctors from all the coasts of the earth,
to give their well-studied judgements, in all points of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
question, which I propose! Neither can I cast my eye
casually upon any of these silent masters, but I must learn
somewhat. It is a wantonness, to complain of choice. No
law binds us to read all: but the more we can take in
and digest, the better-liking must the mind needs be.
Blessed be God, that set up so many clear lamps in his
Church: now, none, but the wilfully blind, can plead
darkness. And blessed be the memory of those his faithful
servants, that have left their blood, their spirits, their lives,
in these precious papers; and have willingly wasted themselves
into these during monuments, to give light unto
others.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Joseph Hall.</span> <i>Occasional Meditations.</i></p>


<h3>REFLECTIONS IN A LIBRARY</h3>

<p>There are more ways to derive instruction from books
than the direct and chief one of applying the attention
to what they contain. Things connected with them, by
natural or casual association, will sometimes suggest themselves
to a reflective and imaginative reader, and divert him
into secondary trains of ideas. In these, the mind may,
indeed, float along in perfect indolence and acquire no good;
but a serious disposition might regulate them to a profitable
result....</p>

<p>Even in the most cursory notice of them, when the attention
is engaged by no one in particular, ideas may be started
of a tendency not wholly foreign to instruction. A reflective
person, in his library, in some hour of intermittent application,
when the mind is surrendered to vagrant musing, may
glance along the ranges of volumes with a slight recognition
of the authors, in long miscellaneous array of ancients and
moderns. And that musing may become shaped into ideas
like these:&mdash;What a number of our busy race have deemed
themselves capable of informing and directing the rest of
mankind! What a vast amount is collected here of the
results of the most strenuous and protracted exertions
of so many minds! What were in each of these claimants
that the world should think as they did, the most prevailing
motives? How many of them sincerely loved truth,
honestly sought it, and faithfully, to the best of their knowledge,
declared it? What might be the circumstances and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
influences which determined in the case of that one author,
and the next, and the next again, their own modes of
opinion?</p>

<p>And how much have they actually done for truth and
righteousness in the world? Do not the contents of these
accumulated volumes constitute a chaos of all discordant
and contradictory principles, theories, representations of
facts, and figurings of imaginations? Could I not instantly
place beside each other the works of two noted authors, who
maintain for truth directly opposite doctrines, or systems
of doctrine; and then add a third book which explodes them
both? I can take some one book in which the prime spirits
of the world, through all time, are brought together, announcing
the speculations which they, respectively, proclaimed
to be the essence of all wisdom, protesting, with solemn
censure or sneering contempt, against the dogmas and
theories of one another, and conflicting in a huge Babel of
all imaginable opinions and vagaries....</p>

<p>Thus far the instructive reflections which even the mere
exterior of an accumulation of books may suggest are supposed
to occur in the way of thinking of the <i>authors</i>. But
the same books may also excite some interesting ideas
through their less obvious but not altogether fanciful association
with the persons who may have been their <i>readers</i> or
<i>possessors</i>. The mind of a thoughtful looker over a range
of volumes of many dates, and a considerable portion of
them old, will sometimes be led into a train of conjectural
questions:&mdash;Who were they that, in various times and
places, have had these in their possession? Perhaps many
hands have turned over the leaves, many eyes have passed
along the lines. With what measure of intelligence, and of
approval or dissent, did those persons respectively follow
the train of thoughts? How many of them were honestly
intent on becoming wise by what they read? How many
sincere prayers were addressed by them to the Eternal
Wisdom during the perusal? How many have been determined,
in their judgement or their actions, by these books?
What emotions, temptations, or painful occurrences, may
have interrupted the reading of this book, or of that?&mdash;<span class="smcap">J.
Foster.</span> <i>Introductory Essay to Doddridge's Rise and
Progress of Religion in the Soul.</i></p>

<h3>THOUGHTS IN A LIBRARY</h3>

<p>A great library! What a mass of human misery is here
commemorated!&mdash;how many buried hopes surround us!</p>

<p>The author of that work was the greatest natural philosopher
that ever enlightened mankind. His biographers
are now disputing whether at one period of his life he was
not of unsound mind&mdash;but all agree that he was afterwards
able to understand his own writings.</p>

<p>The author of those numerous volumes was logician,
metaphysician, natural historian, philosopher; his sanity
was never doubted, and with his last breath he regretted his
birth, mourned over his life, expressed his fear of death, and
called upon the Cause of causes to pity him. His slightest
thoughts continued to domineer over the world for ages,
until they were in some measure silenced by those works
which contain the unfettered meditations of a very great
man, who, being more careless than corrupt in the administration
of his high office, has gone down to posterity, as</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">'The wisest, brightest, meanest, of mankind.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>For his wisdom has embalmed his meanness.</p>

<p>Those volumes contain the weighty, if not wise opinions
of one who, amidst penury and wretchedness, first learnt to
moralize with companions as poor and wretched as himself.
Even in his latter years, when sought by a monarch, and
listened to with submission by all who approached him, his
life can scarcely be called a happy one; yet he must have
enjoyed some moments of triumph, if not of happiness, in
contemplating the severe but well-merited rebuke which he
inflicted upon that courtier, who could behold his difficulties
with all the indifference that belongs to good breeding, and
then thought fit, in the hour of his success, to encumber him
with paltry praises.</p>

<p>Those poems were the burning words of one</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">'... Cradled into poetry by wrong,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Who learnt in suffering what he taught in song.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The slightest foibles of this unhappy man have been brought
into odious prominence, for he was the favourite author of
his age, and therefore the property of the public.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span></p>

<p>That boyish book absolved its author from a father's
cares; and he was one to whom those cares would have been
dearest joys, who loved to look upon a poor man's child.
Listen to the music of his sadness&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">'I see the deep's untrampled floor<br /></span>
<span class="i3">With green and purple seaweeds strown;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">I see the waves upon the shore,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Like light dissolv'd in star-showers, thrown:<br /></span>
<span class="i1">I sit upon the sands alone,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">The lightning of the noon-tide ocean<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Is flashing round me, and a tone<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Arises from its measured motion,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">How sweet! did any heart now share in my emotion!'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The sharp arrows of criticism were successfully directed
against that next volume, and are said to have been the
means of hurrying its author to that world of dreams and
shadows, for which, in the critic's opinion, he was so pre-eminently
fitted.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">'Where is the youth, for deeds immortal born,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Who loved to whisper to the embattled corn,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And clustered woodbines, breathing o'er the stream<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Endymion's beauteous passion for a dream?'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>You already smile, my friend; but to know the heights
and the depths, you must turn your attention to those
numberless, unread, unheard-of volumes. Their authors
did not suffer from the severity of the critic or the judge,
but were only neglected. If Mephistopheles ever requires
rest and seclusion&mdash;But, hark! is there not a laugh? and
that grotesque face in the carved woodwork, how scoffingly
it is looking down upon us!&mdash;<span class="smcap">Sir A. Helps.</span> <i>Thoughts in
a Cloister.</i></p>


<h3>THE TRUE POEM ON THE LIBRARY</h3>

<p>Let us compare the different ways in which Crabbe and
Foster (certainly a <i>prose</i> poet) deal with a library. Crabbe
describes minutely and successfully the outer features of the
volumes, their colours, clasps, the stubborn ridges of their
bindings, the illustrations which adorn them, so well that
you feel yourself among them, and they become sensible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
to touch almost as to sight. But there he stops, and
sadly fails, we think, in bringing out the living and moral
interest which gathers around a multitude of books, or
even around a single volume. This Foster has amply
done. The speaking silence of a number of books, where,
though it were the wide Bodleian or Vatican, not one
whisper could be heard, and yet where, as in an antechamber,
so many great spirits are waiting to deliver
their messages&mdash;their churchyard stillness continuing even
when their readers are moving to their pages, in joy or
agony, as to the sound of martial instruments&mdash;their
awaking, as from deep slumber, to speak with miraculous
organ, like the shell which has only to be lifted, and 'pleased
it remembers its august abodes, and murmurs as the ocean
murmurs there'&mdash;their power of drawing tears, kindling
blushes, awakening laughter, calming or quickening the
motions of the life's-blood, lulling to repose, or rousing to
restlessness&mdash;the meaning which radiates from their quiet
countenances&mdash;the tale of shame or glory which their title-pages
tell&mdash;the memories suggested by the character of
their authors, and of the readers who have throughout
successive centuries perused them&mdash;the thrilling thoughts
excited by the sight of names and notes inscribed on their
margins or blank pages by hands long since mouldered in
the dust, or by those dear to us as our life's-blood, who
have been snatched from our sides&mdash;the aspects of gaiety
or of gloom connected with the bindings and the age of
volumes&mdash;the effects of sunshine playing as if on a congregation
of happy faces, making the duskiest shine and
the gloomiest be glad&mdash;or of shadow suffusing a sombre
air over all&mdash;the joy of the proprietor of a large library,
who feels that Nebuchadnezzar watching great Babylon,
or Napoleon reviewing his legions, will not stand comparison
with himself seated amid the broad maps, and rich prints,
and numerous volumes which his wealth has enabled him
to enjoy&mdash;all such hieroglyphics of interest and meaning
has Foster included and interpreted in one gloomy but
noble meditation, and his introduction to Doddridge is the
true 'Poem on the Library'.&mdash;<span class="smcap">G. Gilfillan.</span> <i>Gallery of

<h3>OF LIBRARIES: THE BODLEIAN</h3>

<p>What oweth Oxford, nay this Isle, to the most worthy
Bodley, whose Library, perhaps, containeth more excellent
books than the ancients by all their curious search could
find?... To such a worthy work all the lovers of learning
should conspire and contribute; and of small beginnings
who is ignorant what great effects may follow? If, perhaps,
we will consider the beginnings of the greatest libraries of
Europe (as Democritus said of the world, that it was made
up of atoms), we shall find them but small; for how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
great soever in their present perfection they are now, these
Carthages were once Magalia. Libraries are as forests, in
which not only tall cedars and oaks are to be found, but
bushes too and dwarfish shrubs; and as in apothecaries'
shops all sorts of drugs are permitted to be, so may all
sorts of books be in a library. And as they out of vipers
and scorpions, and poisoning vegetables, extract often
wholesome medicaments, for the life of mankind; so out
of whatsoever book, good instructions and examples may
be acquired.&mdash;<span class="smcap">William Drummond.</span> <i>Of Libraries.</i></p>

<h3>TO BE CHAINED WITH GOOD AUTHORS</h3>

<p>King James, 1605, when he came to see our University
of Oxford, and amongst other edifices now went to view
that famous library, renewed by Sir Thomas Bodley in
imitation of Alexander at his departure, brake out into
that noble speech, 'If I were not a king, I would be a
University man: and if it were so that I must be a prisoner,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
if I might have my wish, I would desire to have no other
prison than that library, and to be chained together with
so many good authors, <i>et mortuis magistris</i>.' So sweet is
the delight of study, the more learning they have (as he
that hath a dropsy, the more he drinks the thirstier he is)
the more they covet to learn, and the last day is <i>prioris
discipulus</i>; harsh at first learning is, <i>radices amarae</i>, but
<i>fructus dulces</i>, according to that of Isocrates, pleasant at
last; the longer they live, the more they are enamoured
with the Muses. Heinsius, the keeper of the library at
Leyden, in Holland, was mewed up in it all the year long;
and that which to thy thinking should have bred a loathing,
caused in him a greater liking. 'I no sooner (saith he)
come into the library, but I bolt the door to me, excluding
lust, ambition, avarice, and all such vices, whose nurse is Idleness,
the mother of Ignorance, and Melancholy herself, and
in the very lap of eternity, amongst so many divine souls,
I take my seat with so lofty a spirit and sweet content,
that I pity all our great ones, and rich men that know not
this happiness.'</p>

<p>I am not ignorant in the meantime (notwithstanding this
which I have said) how barbarously and basely, for the
most part, our ruder gentry esteem of libraries and books,
how they neglect and contemn so great a treasure, so
inestimable a benefit, as Aesop's cock did the jewel he
found in the dunghill; and all through error, ignorance,
and want of education.&mdash;<span class="smcap">R. Burton.</span> <i>The Anatomy of
Melancholy.</i></p>

<h3>THE BODLEIANS OF OXFORD</h3>

<p>Above all thy rarities, old Oxenford, what do most arride
and solace me, are thy repositories of mouldering learning,
thy shelves&mdash;</p>

<p>What a place to be in is an old library! It seems as
though all the souls of all the writers, that have bequeathed
their labours to these Bodleians, were reposing here, as in
some dormitory, or middle state. I do not want to handle,
to profane the leaves, their winding-sheets. I could as soon
dislodge a shade. I seem to inhale learning, walking amid
their foliage; and the odour of their old moth-scented
coverings is fragrant as the first bloom of those sciential
apples which grew amid the happy orchard.&mdash;<span class="smcap">C. Lamb.</span>
<i>Oxford in the Vacation.</i></p>


<h3>THE BODLEIAN: A DEAD SEA OF BOOKS</h3>

<p>Few places affected me more than the Libraries, and
especially the Bodleian Library, reputed to have half
a million printed books and manuscripts. I walked solemnly
and reverently among the alcoves and through the halls, as
if in the pyramid of embalmed souls. It was their life, their
heart, their mind, that they treasured in these book-urns.
Silent as they are, should all the emotions that went to
their creation have utterance, could the world itself contain
the various sound? They longed for fame? Here it is&mdash;to
stand silently for ages, moved only to be dusted and
catalogued, valued only as units in the ambitious total, and
gazed at, occasionally, by men as ignorant as I am, of their
name, their place, their language, and their worth. Indeed,
unless a man can link his written thoughts with the everlasting
wants of men, so that they shall draw from them
as from wells, there is no more immortality to the thoughts
and feelings of the soul than to the muscles and the bones.
A library is but the soul's burial-ground. It is the land of
shadows.</p>

<p>Yet one is impressed with the thought, the labour, and
the struggle, represented in this vast catacomb of books.
Who could dream, by the placid waters that issue from the
level mouths of brooks into the lake, all the plunges, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
whirls, the divisions, and foaming rushes that had brought
them down to the tranquil exit? And who can guess through
what channels of disturbance, and experiences of sorrow,
the heart passed that has emptied into this Dead Sea of
books?&mdash;<span class="smcap">Henry Ward Beecher.</span> <i>Star Papers.</i></p>

the best friends; in doubts, counsellors; in damp, comforters;
Time's perspective; the home traveller's ship, or
horse, the busy man's best recreation; the opiate of idle
weariness; the mind's best ordinary; Nature's garden and
seed-plot of Immortality. Time spent, needlessly, from
them is consumed, but with them twice gained. Time
captivated and snatched from thee by incursions of business,
thefts of visitants, or by thy own carelessness lost, is by
these redeemed in life; they are the soul's viaticum; and
against death its cordial. In a true verdict, no such treasure
as a library.&mdash;<span class="smcap">B. Whitelocke.</span></p>

<h2><a name="NOTES" id="NOTES"></a>NOTES</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Page</span> 1. <i>Lamb.</i>&mdash;The extracts from the works of Charles Lamb
are from the Oxford edition, edited by T. Hutchinson. Not content
with 'grace' before Milton and Shakespeare, Lamb suggests elsewhere
(see p. <a href="#Page_130">130</a>) a solemn service.</p>

<p>P. 1. <i>Petrarch.</i>&mdash;When the love-sick Petrarch retired from
Avignon to Vaucluse, in 1338, his only companions were his books;
for his friends rarely visited him, alleging that his mode of life was
unnatural. Petrarch replied as in the text, which is quoted from
Mrs. S. Dodson's <i>Life</i>. On another occasion, however, Petrarch
wrote: 'Many have found the multitude of their books a hindrance
to learning, and abundance has bred want, as sometimes happens.
But if the many books are at hand, they are not to be cast aside,
but to be gleaned, and the best used; and care should be taken
that those which might have proved seasonable auxiliaries do not
become hindrances out of season.' See Leigh Hunt's reference on
page <a href="#Page_20">20</a> to Petrarch as 'the god of the Bibliomaniacs'.</p>

<p>P. 2. <i>Waller.</i>&mdash;Carlyle, aged 22, wrote to Robert Mitchell that,
lacking society, he found 'books are a ready and effectual resource'.
'It is lawful,' he added, 'for the solitary wight to express the love
he feels for those companions so steadfast and unpresuming&mdash;that
go or come without reluctance, and that, when his fellow-animals
are proud or stupid or peevish, are ever ready to cheer the languor
of his soul, and gild the barrenness of life with the treasures of
bygone times.'</p>

<p>Walter Pater, in <i>Appreciations: Style</i>, observes that 'different
classes of persons, at different times, make, of course, very various
demands upon literature. Still, scholars, I suppose, and not only
scholars but all disinterested lovers of books, will always look to it,
as to all other fine art, for a refuge, a sort of cloistral refuge, from
a certain vulgarity in the actual world. A perfect poem like <i>Lycidas</i>,
a perfect fiction like <i>Esmond</i>, the perfect handling of a theory like
Newman's <i>Idea of a University</i>, has for them something of the uses
of a religious "retreat".'</p>

<p>P. 4. <i>Chesterfield.</i>&mdash;Folio, a book whose sheets are folded into
two leaves; quarto, sheets folded into four leaves, abbreviated into
4to; octavo, sheets folded into eight leaves, 8vo; duodecimo, sheets
folded into twelve leaves, 12mo. The first three words come to us
from the Italian, through the French; the last is from the Latin
<i>duodecim</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span></p>

<p>P. 5. <i>Southey</i> ('The best of all possible company').&mdash;Castanheda
died in 1559, Barros in 1570, Osorio (da Fonseca) in 1580. They
were Portuguese historians.</p>

<p>P. 6. <i>Emerson.</i></p>

</div></div>

<p>P. 7. <i>Whittier.</i>&mdash;The poet explains that the 'lettered magnate' was
his friend Fields (James Thomas, 1817-81), who edited the <i>Atlantic
Monthly</i>. Among Fields's friends were Leigh Hunt, Barry Cornwall,
Miss Mitford, and Dickens. Longfellow's 'Auf Wiedersehen' was
written 'in memory of J. T. F.', and Whittier himself wrote some
elegiac verse after his death.</p>

<p>It may be noted that Elzevir was the name of a famous family of
Dutch printers, whose books were chiefly issued between 1592 and
1681. Louis Elzevir (? 1540-1617) was the first to make the name
famous.</p>

<p>P. 9. <i>Roscoe.</i>&mdash;The sale of Roscoe's library, necessary on account
of financial failure, took place in August and September 1816. This
Roscoe is the historian of the Medici.</p>

<p>Washington Irving quotes Roscoe's sonnet in his reference to the
incident.</p>

<p>P. 10. <i>Longfellow.</i>&mdash;These valedictory lines were written in
December 1881. In the following year Longfellow died.</p>

<p>P. 10. <i>Jonson.</i>&mdash;Goodyer or Goodier (spelt Goodyere by Herrick)
was the friend of Donne and of many other literary men, and he
wrote verses on his own account. His father, Sir Henry Goodyer,
was the patron of Michael Drayton.</p>

<p>P. 11. <i>Sheridan.</i>&mdash;Written to Dean Swift, then in London.</p>

<p>P. 12. <i>Tupper.</i>&mdash;'Next to possessing a true, wise, and victorious
friend seated by your fireside, it is blessed to have the spirit of such
a friend embodied&mdash;for spirit can assume any embodiment&mdash;on
your bookshelves. But in the latter case the friendship is all on
one side. For full friendship your friend must love you, and know
that you love him.'&mdash;<span class="smcap">George MacDonald.</span></p>

<p>Compare C. S. C.'s parody on page <a href="#Page_135">135</a>; and Goethe's statement
that he only hated parodies 'because they lower the beautiful,
noble, and great'.</p>

<p>P. 13. <i>de Bury.</i>&mdash;Richard de Bury was born near Bury St.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
Edmunds in 1287, his father being Sir Richard Aungervile. He had
a distinguished career at Oxford, and was the tutor of Edward III.
Sent as ambassador to the papal court at Avignon, he formed a
friendship with Petrarch (see pp. <a href="#Page_2">1</a> and <a href="#Page_369">369</a>). While Bishop of Durham,
he was for a short time Lord Chancellor and also Treasurer of
England. He finished the <i>Philobiblon</i> less than three months before
he died, in 1345. Thomas Fuller says that he had more books than
all the other English bishops in that age put together. He had
a library at each of his residences, and Mr. E. C. Thomas tells us,
on the authority of William de Chambre, that wherever he was
residing so many books lay about his bedchamber that it was
hardly possible to stand or move without treading upon them. All
the time he could spare from business was devoted either to religious
offices or to books, and daily at table he would have a book read to
him. The <i>Philobiblon</i> was printed first at Cologne in 1473, then ten
years later at Spires, and in 1500 at Paris. The first edition printed
in England appeared in 1598, and it was a product of the Oxford Press.
It was not until 1832 that any English translation was published.
This, although the name was not divulged in the book, was the work
of John Bellingham Inglis. More than half a century passed before
another translation was made&mdash;that of Mr. Thomas, who personally
examined or collated twenty-eight MSS. Inglis's translation, according
to his successor, is a work of more spirit than accuracy, but
it is the spirit that quickeneth, and it is the 1832 volume which
I have used.</p>

<p>P. 14. <i>Addison.</i>&mdash;Ovid, <i>Met.</i> xv. 871:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">&mdash;which nor dreads the rage<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Of tempests, fire, or war, or wasting age.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Welsted.</span><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Fielding says in <i>Tom Jones</i>:&mdash;'I question not but the ingenious
author of the <i>Spectator</i> was principally induced to prefix Greek and
Latin mottoes to every paper, from the same consideration of guarding
against the pursuit of those scribblers who, having no talents of
a writer but what is taught by the writing-master, are yet not more
afraid nor ashamed to assume the same titles with the greatest
genius, than their good brother in the fable was of braying in the
lion's skin. By the device, therefore, of his motto, it became impracticable
for any man to presume to imitate the <i>Spectators</i>, without
understanding at least one sentence in the learned languages.'</p>

<p>'No praise of Addison's style,' Lord Lytton declares, 'can exaggerate
its merits. Its art is perfectly marvellous. No change of
time can render the workmanship obsolete. His manner has that
nameless urbanity in which we recognize the perfection of manner&mdash;courteous,
but not courtier-like; so dignified, yet so kindly; so
easy, yet so high-bred. Its form of English is fixed&mdash;a safe and
eternal model, of which all imitation pleases&mdash;to which all approach
is scholarship&mdash;like the Latin of the Augustan age.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span></p>

<p>So much for style. For the rest Hazlitt remarks that 'it is the
extremely moral and didactic tone of the <i>Spectator</i> which makes
us apt to think of Addison (according to Mandeville's sarcasm) as
"a parson in a tie-wig"'. How often history repeats itself.</p>

<p>P. 15. <i>Dodd.</i>&mdash;His <i>Beauties of Shakespeare</i>, published in 1752, is
still well known. Dodd was hanged for forgery, despite many efforts,
including those of Dr. Johnson, on his behalf.</p>

<p>P. 16. <i>Hunt.</i>&mdash;The periods referred to by Leigh Hunt are 'the
dark ages, as they are called', and 'the gay town days of Charles II,
or a little afterwards'. In the first the essayist imagines 'an age
of iron warfare and energy, with solitary retreats, in which the
monk or the hooded scholar walks forth to meditate, his precious
volume under his arm. In the other, I have a triumphant example
of the power of books and wit to contest the victory with sensual
pleasure:&mdash;Rochester staggering home to pen a satire in the style
of Monsieur Boileau; Butler, cramming his jolly duodecimo with
all the learning that he laughed at; and a new race of book poets
come up, who, in spite of their periwigs and petit-maîtres, talk as
romantically of "the bays" as if they were priests of Delphos.'</p>

<p>In Chapman's translation of Homer occur the words: 'The
fortresses of thorniest queaches.' A queach is a thick bushy plot,
or a quickset hedge.</p>

<p>P. 18. <i>Burton.</i>&mdash;Compare the remark of the 'Hammock School'
reviewers in Mr. G. K. Chesterton's <i>The Napoleon of Notting Hill</i>&mdash;'Next
to authentic goodness in a book (and that, alas! we never
find) we desire a rich badness.'</p>

<p>P. 19. <i>Channing.</i>&mdash;An address introductory to the Franklin
lectures delivered at Boston, 1838. Channing's influence increased
after his death, which occurred in 1842. In the seventies nearly
50,000 copies of his <i>Complete Works</i> were circulated in America
and Europe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span></p>

<p>P. 20. <i>Hunt.</i>&mdash;The novel <i>Camilla</i> is Madame D'Arblay's; the
entire passage relating to the Oxford scholar's books is given on
page 216. Petrarch is quoted on pages 1 and 369.</p>

<p>P. 21. <i>Landor.</i>&mdash;See 'Old-Fashioned Verse' on p. <a href="#Page_186">186</a>.</p>

<p>P. 26. <i>Burton.</i>&mdash;Lord Byron is reported by Moore to have said:
'The book, in my opinion, most useful to a man who wishes to
acquire the reputation of being well read, with the least trouble,
is Burton's <i>Anatomy of Melancholy</i>, the most amusing and instructive
medley of quotations and classical anecdotes I ever perused. But
a superficial reader must take care, or his intricacies will bewilder
him. If, however, he has patience to go through his volumes, he
will be more improved for literary conversation than by the perusal
of any twenty other works with which I am acquainted, at least in
the English language.'</p>

<p>Dr. Johnson, while admitting that the <i>Anatomy</i> is a valuable work,
suggests that it is overloaded with quotation. But he adds, 'It is
the only book that ever took me out of bed two hours sooner than
I wished to rise.'</p>

<p>P. 28. <i>Southey.</i>&mdash;'Southey's appearance is <i>Epic</i>; and he is the
only existing entire man of letters. All the others have some pursuit
annexed to their authorship'.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Lord Byron.</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i11">Ye, loved books, no more<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Shall Southey feed upon your precious lore,<br /></span>

<span class="i6">(Inscription for a monument in Crosthwaite Church).<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>P. 32. <i>Montaigne.</i>&mdash;Michel Eyquem, Seigneur de Montaigne,
began to write his essays in his château at Montaigne in Périgord
in 1572, at the age of thirty-nine. The essays were published in
1580, and five editions had appeared before his death in 1592.</p>

<p><i>The Essayes of Michael Lord of Montaigne</i> translated by John
Florio were first published in 1603. The translator was born in
London about 1553, and he died in 1625. It is this translation
from which my excerpts are given, and it is the only book known
to have been in Shakespeare's library; the volume contains his
autograph, and is now in the British Museum.</p>

<p>Emerson classes Montaigne in his <i>Representative Men</i> as the
Sceptic. He calls to mind that Gibbon reckoned, in the bigoted
times of the period, but two men of liberality in France&mdash;Henry IV
and Montaigne&mdash;and adds, 'Though a Biblical plainness, coupled
with a most uncanonical levity, may shut his pages to many sensitive
readers, yet the offence is superficial.... I know not anywhere the
book that seems less written. It is the language of conversation
transferred to a book.'</p>

<p>P. 33. <i>Denham.</i>&mdash;Dominico Mancini wrote the <i>Libellus de quattuor
Virtutibus</i>, published in Paris, 1484.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span></p>

<p>P. 37. <i>Johnson.</i>&mdash;The excerpts from Johnson and from Boswell's
<i>Life</i> are taken, where possible, from Dr. Birkbeck Hill's Oxford
edition.</p>

<p>P. 41. <i>Rabelais.</i>&mdash;The translation is that of Peter Anthony
Motteux (1660-1718) and of Sir Thomas Urquhart (1611-1660).</p>

<p>It may be remembered that Pantagruel on his travels found
in Paris 'the library of St. Victor, a very stately and magnificent
one, especially in some books which were there', of which the
Repertory or Catalogue is given. A few of the titles are:&mdash;<i>The
Pomegranate of Vice</i>, <i>The Henbane of the Bishops</i>, <i>The Crucible
of Contemplation</i>, <i>The Flimflams of the Law</i>, <i>The Pleasures of the
Monachal Life</i>, <i>Sixty-nine fat Breviaries</i>, and <i>The Chimney-sweeper
of Astrology</i>. Some of the titles are too 'Rabelaesian', or what
some booksellers call 'curious', to print. A certain number of the
books appear to have actually existed outside the author's imagination.</p>

<p>P. 45. <i>Herrick.</i>&mdash;These are, of course, separate poems, scattered
fruit of the <i>Hesperides</i>. See also the note on page <a href="#Page_390">390</a>.</p>

<p>'Absyrtus-like': an allusion, of course, to the story of Medea, who
took her brother Absyrtus with her when she fled with Jason. Being
nearly overtaken by her father, Medea murdered Absyrtus, and
strewed the road with pieces of his body so that the pursuit might
be stayed.</p>

<p>P. 46. <i>Daniel.</i>&mdash;This sonnet was prefaced to the second edition
of Florio's <i>Montaigne</i> (1613), and is often ascribed to the translator;
but the weight of criticism credits the authorship to Daniel. Mr.
Locker-Lampson was tempted to write a couple of verses for the
fly-leaf of the Rowfant Montaigne, which not only belonged to
Shakespeare, but was also given by Pope to Gay and enjoyed by
Johnson:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">For me the halycon days have passed,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">I'm here and with a dunce at last.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>See note on previous page.</p>

<p>P. 47. <i>Milton.</i>&mdash;Milton's prose masterpiece was printed, in a
modified form, by Mirabeau, under the title <i>Sur la Liberté de la
Presse</i>, imité de l'Anglais, de Milton.</p>

<p>P. 49. <i>Leighton.</i>&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div></div>

<p>P. 49. <i>Hazlitt.</i>&mdash;'Because they both wrote essays and were fond
of the Elizabethans,' Mr. Augustine Birrell says, 'it became the
fashion to link Hazlitt's name with Lamb's. Hazlitt suffered by
the comparison.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span></p>

<p>P. 50. <i>Hunt.</i>&mdash;The poet is Wordsworth and the lines 'Oh that
my name' are found in 'Personal Talk'. See page <a href="#Page_21">21</a>.</p>

<p>P. 52. <i>Carlyle.</i>&mdash;In <i>The Hero as Priest</i> Carlyle wrote of Luther's
written works: 'The dialect of these speculations is now grown
obsolete for us; but one still reads them with a singular attraction.
And indeed the mere grammatical diction is still legible enough;
Luther's merit in literary history is of the greatest; his dialect
became the language of all writing. They are not well written,
these Four-and-twenty Quartos of his; written hastily, with quite
other than literary objects. But in no Books have I found a more
robust, genuine, I will say noble faculty of a man than in these.
A rugged honesty, homeliness, simplicity; a rugged sterling sense
and strength. He flashes-out illumination from him; his smiting
idiomatic phrases seem to cleave into the very secret of the matter.
Good humour too, nay, tender affection, nobleness, and depth:
this man could have been a Poet too! He had to <i>work</i> an Epic

there is Gutenberg bringing forth books. One sower heralds the

<p>P. 77. <i>Ascham.</i>&mdash;Thomas Blundeville wrote some lines in praise
of Roger Ascham's Latin grammar:&mdash;</p>

<p>This was published in 1561.</p>

<p>P. 78. <i>Wither.</i>&mdash;Bevis of Hampton, a hero of early mediaeval
romance. The story has been published by the Early English Text
Society.</p>

<p>Compare 'The common rabble of scribblers and blur-papers which
nowadays stuff stationers' shops.'&mdash;<span class="smcap">Montaigne.</span></p>

<p>P. 79. <i>Fuller.</i>&mdash;The other portion of this essay will be found on
page <a href="#Page_57">57</a>. Arius Montanus was the court chaplain of Philip II of
Spain, and he personally superintended the printing of the <i>Biblia
Polyglotta</i> (8 vols., 1569-73), the most famous of the books printed
by Christophe Plantin. The printing office is one of the sights
of Antwerp, whose council bought the property from Plantin's
descendants in 1876 for £48,000.</p>

<p>Compare also: 'Evil books corrupt at once both our manners
and our taste.'&mdash;<span class="smcap">Fielding.</span></p>

<p>P. 80. <i>Addison.</i>&mdash;Addison 'takes off the severity of this speculation'
with an anecdote of an atheistical author who was sick unto
death. A curate, to comfort him, said he did not believe any besides
the author's particular friends or acquaintance had ever been at
the pains of reading his book, or that anybody after his death
would ever inquire after it. 'The dying Man had still so much the
Frailty of an Author in him, as to be cut to the Heart with these
Consolations; and without answering the good Man, asked his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
Friends about him (with a Peevishness that is natural to a sick
Person) where they had picked up such a Blockhead?' It seems
that the author recovered, 'and has since written two or three other
Tracts with the same Spirit, and very luckily for his poor Soul with
the same success.'</p>

<p>P. 83. <i>Milton.</i>&mdash;'For he [Pliny the Elder] read no book which he
did not make extracts from. He used to say that "no book was so
bad but some good might be got out of it."'&mdash;<span class="smcap">Pliny the Younger.</span></p>

<p>P. 84. <i>Baxter.</i>&mdash;'Richard, Richard, dost thou think we will let
thee poison the court? Richard, thou art an old knave. Thou
hast written books enough to load a cart, and every book as full of
sedition as an egg is full of meat.'&mdash;Judge Jeffreys' address at
Baxter's trial.</p>

<p>P. 85. <i>Athenian Mercury.</i>&mdash;An 'answer to correspondents'&mdash;the
question 'Whether 'tis lawful to read Romances?' being asked
in <i>The Athenian Mercury</i>. This, the first popular periodical published
in this country, was started in 1691, and written by John
Dunton, R. Sault, and Samuel (the father of John) Wesley; the
last number appeared in 1697, and Dunton collected into three
volumes the most valuable questions and answers under the title of
<i>The Athenian Oracle</i>.</p>

<p>Gray's wish was to be always lying on sofas, reading 'eternal
new novels of Crébillon and Marivaux'.</p>

<p>P. 86. <i>Cobbett.</i>&mdash;Cobbett attacks Dr. Johnson, because in a pamphlet
he urged war on the American colonies; Burke, because in
another pamphlet he urged war on revolutionary France. 'The
first war lost us America, the last cost us six hundred millions of
money, and has loaded us with forty millions a year of taxes.'</p>

<p>P. 86. <i>More.</i>&mdash;Tom Hickathrift, who killed a giant at Tylney,
Norfolk, with a cartwheel. He dates from the Conquest, and was
made governor of Thanet.</p>

<p>P. 87. <i>Austen.</i>&mdash;<i>Cecilia</i> and <i>Camilla</i>, both by Mme. D'Arblay;
<i>Belinda</i>, by Miss Edgeworth.</p>

others' works.'&mdash;<span class="smcap">Burton.</span></p>

<p>P. 90. <i>Milton.</i>&mdash;South said that <i>Eikon Basilike</i> was 'composed with
such an unfailing majesty of diction, that it seems to have been
written with a sceptre rather than a pen'.</p>

<p>Milton condemns the king for having 'so little care of truth in
his last words, or honour to himself, or to his friends, or sense of
his afflictions, or of that sad hour which was upon him, as immediately
before his death to pop into the hand of that grave bishop<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
[Juxon] who attended him, for a special relic of his saintly exercises,
a prayer stolen word for word from the mouth of a heathen woman
praying to a heathen god; and that in no serious book, but the
vain amatorious poem of Sir Philip Sidney's <i>Arcadia</i>'.</p>

<p>P. 91. <i>Dryden.</i>&mdash;Hazlitt, who could not 'much relish Ben
Jonson', describes him as 'a great borrower from the works of
others, and a plagiarist even from nature; so little freedom is there
in his imitations of her, and he appears to receive her bounty like
an alms'. J. A. Symonds, stating that Jonson 'held the prose
writers and poets of antiquity in solution in his spacious memory',
points out that such looting on his part of classical treasuries of
wit and wisdom was accounted no robbery in his age.</p>

<p>P. 91. <i>Sheridan.</i>&mdash;Churchill has the same thought in <i>The Apology</i>:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p>P. 93. <i>Pattison.</i>&mdash;Matthew Arnold, in the preface to <i>Literature
and Dogma</i> (1873), points out that 'To read to good purpose we
must read a great deal, and be content not to use a great deal of
what we read. We shall never be content not to use the whole, or
nearly the whole, of what we read, unless we read a great
deal.'</p>

<p>P. 96. <i>Mitford.</i>&mdash;'Every abridgement of a good book is a stupid
abridgement.'&mdash;<span class="smcap">Montaigne.</span></p>

<p>P. 98. <i>Tennyson.</i>&mdash;J. J. Jusserand, in the first annual Shakespeare
lecture before the British Academy (July 5, 1911), used
eloquent language which might be said to justify bibliographies:&mdash;'Books,
like their authors, have their biography. They live their
own lives. Some behave like honourable citizens of the world of
thought, do good, propagate sound views, strengthen heart and
courage, assuage, console, improve those men to whose hearths they
have been invited. Others corrupt or debase, or else turn minds
towards empty frivolities. In proportion to their fame, and to the
degree of their perenniality, is the good or evil that they do from
century to century, eternal benefactors of mankind or deathless
malefactors. Posted on the road followed by humanity, they help
or destroy the passers-by; they deserve gratitude eternal, or levy
the toll of some of our life's blood, leaving us weaker; highwaymen
or good Samaritans. Some make themselves heard at once and
continue to be listened to for ever; others fill the ears for one or
two generations, and then begin an endless sleep; or, on the contrary,
long silent or misunderstood, they awake from their torpor,
and astonished mankind discovers with surprise long-concealed
treasures like those trodden upon by the unwary visitor of unexplored
ruins.'</p>

<p>P. 99. <i>Helps.</i>&mdash;'My desire is ... that mine adversary had written
a book.'&mdash;The Author of Job, ch. 31.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span></p>

<p>'Curll, Pope's victim and accomplice ... hit on one of those
epoch-making ideas which are so simple when once they are conceived,
so difficult, save for the loftiest genius, in their first conception.
It occurred to him that, in a world governed by the law
of mortality, men might be handsomely entertained on one another's
remains. He lost no time in putting his theory into action. During
the years of his activity he published some forty or fifty separate

notorious persons who had the ill-fortune to die during his lifetime....
His books commanded a large sale, and modern biography
was established.'&mdash;<span class="smcap">Sir W. Raleigh.</span> <i>Six Essays on Johnson.</i></p>

<p>It is related in <i>The Percy Anecdotes</i> that 'A gentleman calling on
Archbishop Tillotson observed in his library one shelf of books of
various forms and sizes, all richly bound, finely gilt and lettered.
He inquired what favourite authors these were that had been so
remarkably distinguished by his Grace. "These," said the Archbishop,
"are my own personal friends; and what is more I have
made them such (for they were avowedly my enemies), by the use
I have made of those hints which their malice had suggested to me.
From these I have received more profit than from the advice of my
best and most cordial friends; and therefore you see I have rewarded
them accordingly."'</p>

<p>P. 99. <i>Disraeli.</i>&mdash;Compare Emerson: 'There is properly no
history, only biography; and Carlyle: 'History is the essence of
innumerable biographies.'</p>

<p>'Those that write of men's lives,' says Montaigne, 'forasmuch as
they amuse and busy themselves more about counsels than events,
more about that which cometh from within than that which appeareth
outward; they are fittest for me.'</p>

<p>P. 102. <i>Glanvill.</i>&mdash;An original Fellow of the Royal Society, and
in many ways an interesting divine, probably best known in these
days through Matthew Arnold's 'Scholar-Gypsy', whose story is
told in <i>The Vanity of Dogmatizing</i> (1661), from which this quotation
and that on page <a href="#Page_118">118</a> are made.</p>

<p>P. 103. <i>Jonson.</i>&mdash;The poem 'To the Memory of my Beloved
Master William Shakespeare, and what he hath left us' appeared
in 1623.</p>

<p>P. 105. <i>Jonson.</i>&mdash;This was printed in the First Folio of Shakespeare's
works, 1623, on the page opposite the Droeshout portrait.</p>

<p>P. 105. <i>Milton.</i>&mdash;These lines were printed anonymously in the
Second Folio Shakespeare, 1632, and, it is believed, this was Milton's
first appearance as a poet.</p>

<p>P. 106. <i>Dryden.</i>&mdash;This was printed under the engraving in
Tonson's folio edition of <i>Paradise Lost</i> (1688). Mr. F. A. Mumby, in
<i>The Romance of Bookselling</i>, recalls that in Moseley's first edition
of Milton's poems there was an atrocious portrait of the poet by
William Marshall. Milton wrote four lines in Greek, which the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>
artist, innocent of that language, gravely cut into the plate, lines
that Dr. Masson has thus translated:</p>

<span class="i1">Laugh at the botching artist's mis-attempt.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>P. 106. <i>Fletcher.</i>&mdash;The subject of this poem was Giles Fletcher,
the author of <i>Christ's Victory and Triumph</i>, 'equally beloved of the
Muses and Graces.'</p>

<p>P. 106. <i>Crashaw.</i>&mdash;From <i>The Flaming Heart</i>. 'His masterpiece,
one of the most astonishing things in English or any literature, comes
without warning at the end of <i>The Flaming Heart</i>. For page after
page the poet has been playing on some trifling conceit ... and
then in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, without warning of
any sort, the metre changes, the poet's inspiration catches fire, and
then rushes up into the heaven of poetry the marvellous rocket of
song: "Live in these conquering leaves," &amp;c. The contrast is
perhaps unique as regards the colourlessness of the beginning and
the splendid colour of the end. But contrasts like it occur all over
Crashaw's work.'&mdash;<span class="smcap">Professor Saintsbury.</span> <i>History of Elizabethan
Literature.</i></p>

<p>As an interesting example of Crashaw's conceits it may be noted
that, when alluding to Mary Magdalene, he speaks of her eyes as
'Portable and compendious oceans.'</p>

<p>P. 107. <i>Voltaire.</i>&mdash;The philosopher also remarks, in the same
article, that 'there is hardly a single philosophical or theological
book in which heresies and impieties may not be found by misinterpreting,
or adding to, or subtracting from, the sense'.</p>

<p>P. 112. <i>Carlyle.</i>&mdash;Abelard, born 1079, died 1142, is less known
now as a famous teacher at the University of Paris than as the
lover of Héloise.</p>

<p>P. 113. <i>Trapp and Browne.</i>&mdash;When George I sent a present
of some books, in November 1715, to the University of Cambridge,
he sent at the same time a troop of horse to Oxford. This
inspired Dr. Trapp and provoked the rejoinder from Sir William
Browne.</p>

<p>P. 114. <i>Earle.</i>&mdash;Mr. A. S. West, in his edition of Earle's <i>Microcosmographie;
or a Piece of the World discovered; in Essayes and
Characters</i>, says: 'The critic supposed that <i>omneis</i> was the original
form of the accusative plural of <i>omnis</i>, and that the forms <i>omnes</i>
and <i>omnis</i> had taken its place. In order to adhere to the older spelling
"he writes <i>omneis</i> at length". <i>Quicquid</i> is cited as an instance of
pedantry because the ordinary man wrote the word as <i>quidquid</i>,
and doubtless so pronounced it. The critic's gerund may be described
as "inconformable" because it resists attraction&mdash;remains a gerund
and does not become a gerundive. Or Earle may have had in view<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
passages in which the gerund of transitive verbs with <i>est</i> govern an
object.'</p>

<p>P. 115. <i>Goldsmith.</i>&mdash;'When Dr. Johnson is free to confess that
he does not admire Gray's <i>Elegy</i>, and Macaulay to avow that
he sees little to praise in Dickens and Wordsworth, why should not
humbler folks have the courage of their opinions?' Such is the
question asked by James Payn in the <i>Nineteenth Century</i> (March
1880), his article being entitled 'Sham Admiration in Literature'.
Mr. Payn noted that 'curiously enough, it is women who have the
most courage in the expression of their literary opinions', instancing
the authoress of <i>Jane Eyre</i>, who 'did not derive much pleasure
from the perusal of the works of the other Jane [Austen]', and
Harriet Martineau, who confessed to him that she could see no
beauties in <i>Tom Jones</i>.</p>

<p>'There is no ignorance more shameful than to admit as true that
which one does not understand: and there is no advantage so great
as that of being set free from error.'&mdash;<span class="smcap">Xenophon.</span> <i>Memorabilia.</i></p>

<p>P. 118. <i>Fielding.</i>&mdash;'What a master of composition Fielding was!
Upon my word, I think the <i>Oedipus Tyrannus</i>, <i>The Alchemist</i>, and
<i>Tom Jones</i>, the three most perfect plots ever planned.... How
charming, how wholesome, Fielding always is!'&mdash;<span class="smcap">S. T. Coleridge.</span>
<i>Table Talk.</i></p>

<p>P. 123. <i>Erasmus.</i>&mdash;The translation is the work of Nathaniel
Bailey, lexicographer and schoolmaster, who died in 1742. Desiderius
and Erasmus are Latin and Greek for Gerhard 'the beloved',
the name of the scholar's father.</p>

<p>P. 123. <i>Colton.</i>&mdash;Compare R. B. Sheridan's: 'Easy writing's
curst hard reading.'</p>

<p>P. 124. <i>Bacon.</i>&mdash;Mr. A. S. Gaye, in the new Clarendon Press
edition of the <i>Essays</i>, points out that on almost every page the reader
will find quotations from the Bible and from the Greek and Latin
classics, especially Tacitus, Plutarch, Cicero, Virgil, Seneca, and
Ovid, besides frequent allusions to biblical, classical, and mediaeval
history. 'It is also remarkable that the quotations are more often
than not inaccurate, not only in words but in sense.... Bacon
furnished in himself an exception to the rule which he laid down in
his Essay "Of Studies"; for though "reading" made him "a
full man", "writing" did not make him "an exact man".'</p>

<p>P. 128. <i>Boswell.</i>&mdash;One of Mrs. Piozzi's anecdotes of Dr. Johnson
is that he asked 'Was there ever yet anything written by mere
man that was wished longer by its readers excepting <i>Don Quixote</i>,
<i>Robinson Crusoe</i>, and the <i>Pilgrim's Progress</i>?' Johnson declared
that the work of Cervantes was the greatest in the world, 'speaking
of it, I mean, as a book of entertainment.'</p>

<p>P. 132. <i>Emerson.</i>&mdash;Shakespeare's phrase: <i>Taming of the Shrew</i>,

<p>P. 133. <i>Emerson.</i>&mdash;O. W. Holmes applies the proverb to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span>

extent on what you carry to it.'</p>

<p>P. 135. <i>Calverley.</i>&mdash;See Tupper's lines on page <a href="#Page_12">12</a>. The allusions
are, of course, to the creations of Bulwer-Lytton.</p>

<p>P. 138. <i>Gibbon.</i>&mdash;F. W. Robertson's opinion is worth recording:
'It is very surprising to find how little we retain of a book, how
little we have really made our own, when we come to interrogate
ourselves as to what account we can give of it, however we may
seem to have mastered it by understanding it. Hundreds of books
read once have passed as completely from us as if we had never
read them; whereas the discipline of mind got by writing down,
not copying, an abstract of a book which is worth the trouble, fixes
it on the mind for years, and, besides, enables one to read other
books with more attention and more profit.'</p>

on is your own, and perhaps is rather too elaborate a counsel of
perfection for most of us.'&mdash;<span class="smcap">Lord Morely.</span></p>

<p>Butler, writing of 'A small poet' (<i>Characters</i>), says: 'There
was one that lined a hat-case with a paper of Benlowe's poetry:
Prynne bought it by chance, and put a new demicastor into it.
The first time he wore it he felt a singing in his head, which within
two days turned to a vertigo.' A 'demicastor' is a hat.</p>

<p>P. 147. <i>Scott.</i>&mdash;Mr. W. J. Courthope, in his Warton Lecture on
English Poetry before the British Academy, read on October 25,
1911, observes that 'the best illustration of historic change in
"romantic" temper is perhaps to be found in a comparison of
Cervantes' account of the character of Don Quixote [see p. <a href="#Page_155">155</a>]
with Walter Scott's representation of the romanticism of the hero
of <i>Waverley</i>. Don Quixote's "fancy", says Cervantes, "grew full
of what he used to read about in his books, enchantments, battles,
challenges, wounds, wooings, loves, agonies, and all sorts of impossible
nonsense; and it so possessed his mind that the whole fabric
of invention and fancy he read of was true, that to him no history
in the world had more reality in it." ... "My intention," says Scott,
"is not to follow the steps of the inimitable Cervantes in describing
such total perversion of intellect as misconstrues the objects actually
presented to the senses, but the more common aberration from
sound judgement, which apprehends occurrences indeed in their
reality, but communicates to them a tincture of its own romantic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>
colouring."' Scott expatiates at length on Waverley's reading in
the third chapter of his novel.</p>

<p>P. 148. <i>Boswell.</i>&mdash;Macaulay writes in his review of Southey's
edition of <i>The Pilgrim's Progress</i>: 'Doctor Johnson, all whose
studies were desultory, and who hated, as he said, to read books
through, made an exception in favour of <i>The Pilgrim's Progress</i>.
That work was one of the two or three works which he wished
longer. It was by no common merit that the illiterate sectary
extracted praise like this from the most pedantic of critics and the
most bigoted of Tories.'</p>

<p>Boswell relates that Dr. Johnson 'had a peculiar facility in seizing
at once what was valuable in any book, without submitting to
the labour of perusing it from beginning to end.'</p>

<p>P. 149. <i>Chandos.</i>&mdash;The authorship of <i>Horae Subsecivae</i> is not
absolutely known, but it is attributed to James I's favourite courtier.
It was published in 1620, the year before Chandos died.</p>

<p>P. 149. <i>Waller.</i>&mdash;'A library well chosen cannot be too extensive,
but some there are who amass a great quantity of books, which they
keep for show, and not for service. Of such persons, Louis XI of
France aptly enough observed, that "they resembled <i>hunch-backed</i>
people, who carried a great burden, which <i>they never saw</i>".'&mdash;<span class="smcap">W.
Keddie</span>. <i>Cyclopaedia</i>.</p>

<p>P. 153. <i>Coleridge.</i>&mdash;The most deadly thing that Coleridge wrote
was when he classed the patrons of the circulating libraries as lower
in the scale than that reading public nine-tenths of whose reading
is confined to periodicals and 'Beauties, elegant Extracts and
Anas [Anecdotes]'.</p>

<p>P. 153. <i>Boswell.</i>&mdash;Dr. Birkbeck Hill points out that Boswell
alludes to this opinion in one of his letters, modestly adding:
'I am afraid I have not read books enough to be able to talk from
them.' Johnson particularized Langton as talking from books, 'and
Garrick would if he talked seriously.'</p>

<p>P. 154. <i>S. Smith.</i>&mdash;Bettinelli, a scholar and a Jesuit (1718-1808),
who attacked the reputation of Dante and Petrarch.</p>

<p>Coventry Patmore wrote: 'If you want to shine as a diner-out,
the best way is to know something which others do not know, and
not to know many things which everybody knows. This takes much
less reading, and is doubly effective, inasmuch as it makes you a
really good, that is, an interested listener, as well as a talker.'&mdash;(<i>On
Obscure Books.</i>)</p>

<p>P. 154. <i>Colton.</i>&mdash;'Methinks 'tis a pitiful piece of knowledge that
can be learnt from an index and a poor ambition to be rich in the
inventory of another's treasure.'&mdash;<span class="smcap">J. Glanvill.</span> <i>The Vanity of

<p>P. 155. <i>Cervantes.</i>&mdash;A whole chapter is devoted to the destruction
of Don Quixote's library. (Part i, chap, vi.) The books that,
condemned by the priest, were passed into the housekeeper's hands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
and thence into the fire were:&mdash;<i>Adventures of Esplandian</i>; <i>Amadis
of Greece</i>; <i>Don Olivante de Laura</i>; <i>Florismarte of Hyrcania</i>; <i>The
Knight Platir</i>; <i>The Knight of the Cross</i>; <i>Bernardo del Carpio</i>;
<i>Roncesvalles</i>; <i>Palmerin de Oliva</i>; <i>Diana</i>, called the Second, by
Salmantino; <i>The Shepherd of Iberia</i>; <i>The Nymphs of Henares</i>;
and <i>The Curse of Jealousy</i>. The priest, however, put by for further
examination or determined to save: <i>Amadis de Gaul</i>; <i>The Mirror
of Chivalry</i>, and 'all other books that shall be found treating of
French matters'; <i>Palmerin of England</i>; <i>Don Belianis</i>; <i>Tirante
the White</i>; <i>Diana</i>, of Montemayor, and its continuation by Gil Polo;
<i>Ten Books of the Fortune of Love</i>; <i>The Shepherd of Filida</i>; <i>The
Treasure of Divers Poems</i> (de Padilla); <i>Book of Songs</i>, by Lopez
Maldonado; <i>Galatea</i>, by Cervantes; <i>Araucana</i>; <i>Austriada</i>;
<i>Monserrate</i>; and the <i>Tears of Angelica</i>. The curious reader will
find these volumes traced in the admirable notes in J. Fitzmaurice-Kelly's
edition of <i>Don Quixote</i> in 'The World's Classics'. Cervantes,
Mr. Fitzmaurice-Kelly says, devoured in his wandering youth,
'those folios of chivalrous adventures which he, and he alone, has
saved from the iniquity of oblivion'. The early association of
Barabbas and books will be noticed.</p>

<p>It is the translation by Charles Jervas, first published in 1742,
which is here employed.</p>

<p><i>The Renowned Romance of Amadis of Gaul</i>, by Vasco Lobeira,
which was expressly condemned by Montaigne (see p. <a href="#Page_144">144</a>), was translated
from the Spanish version of Garciodonez de Montalvo by
Southey.</p>

<p>P. 159. <i>Ruskin.</i>&mdash;As Mr. Frederic Harrison points out, 'Books
are no more education than laws are virtue; and, just as profligacy
is easy within the strict limits of law, a boundless knowledge of
books may be found with a narrow education.'</p>

<p>P. 159. <i>E. B. Browning.</i>&mdash;This letter was written to 'Orion'
Horne three years before Mrs. Browning's marriage in 1843, when
she was thirty-seven. Compare Matthew Arnold in the preface to
<i>Literature and Dogma</i> (1873): 'Nothing can be truer than what
Butler says, that really, in general, no part of our time is more
idly spent than the time spent in reading. Still, culture is indispensably
necessary, and culture is reading; but reading with a purpose

<p>P. 162. <i>Blackie.</i>&mdash;'Reading is seeing by proxy&mdash;is learning indirectly

reader happy:&mdash;</p>

<p>'Cooks, warriors, and authors must be judged by the effects they
produce: toothsome dishes, glorious victories, pleasant books&mdash;these
are our demands....</p>

<p>'Literature exists to please&mdash;to lighten the burden of men's lives;
to make them for a short while forget their sorrows and their sins,
their silenced hearths, their disappointed hopes, their grim futures&mdash;and
those men of letters are the best loved who have best performed
literature's truest office.'</p>

<p>P. 169. <i>Chaucer.</i>&mdash;The book referred to is Ovid's <i>Metamorphoses</i>.</p>

<p>P. 169. <i>Digby.</i>&mdash;Sir Kenelm Digby's 'observations' are generally
printed with <i>Religio Medici</i>, although in a letter to Sir T. Browne,
who had written to him on the subject, he explained that the hastily
set down notes did not merit the press, and would 'serve only for
a private letter, or a familiar discourse with lady-auditors'.</p>

<p>To Sir Thomas Browne, 'a library,' says Coleridge, 'was a living
world, and every book a man, absolute flesh and blood.'</p>

claims to give 'practical examples worthy to be followed in the

Billy is the first-born. Locke's treatise was published in 1693, or
forty-seven years before Richardson's novel, and the philosopher
observes 'That most Children's Constitutions are either spoiled, or

<p>P. 188. <i>Dickens.</i>&mdash;Of this passage, Forster says in the <i>Life of
Dickens</i>, 'It is one of the many passages in <i>Copperfield</i> which are
literally true.... Every word of this personal recollection had been
written down as fact, some years before it found its way into <i>David
Copperfield</i>; the only change in the fiction being his omission of
the name of a cheap series of novelists then in course of publication,
by means of which his father had become happily the owner of so
large a lump of literary treasure in his small collection of books.'</p>

<p>Apropos of Defoe, Macaulay, who could not 'understand the

that a certain man, of the name of Similis, who fought under the
Emperor Hadrian, became so wearied and disgusted with the number
of troublesome events which he met with in that mode of life, that
he retired and devoted himself wholly to leisure and reading, and
to meditations upon divine and human affairs, after the manner of
Pythagoras. In this retirement, Similis was wont frequently to
exclaim that '<i>now</i> he began to <i>live</i>': at his death he desired the
following inscription to be placed upon his tomb.</p>

But by some the lines are credited to Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey,
who is memorable, among other things, for introducing the sonnet

<p>The <i>Virgil</i> of Ogilby, or Ogilvy, originally a dancing-master, was
published in 1649, and was the first complete English translation
(Ogilby is mentioned by Pope, see page <a href="#Page_313">313</a>); <i>Cassandra</i>, <i>Cleopatra</i>,
<i>Astraea</i>, <i>The Grand Cyrus</i> and <i>Clelia</i> were French romances translated
into English. Sidney called his pastoral romance <i>The Countess of
Pembroke's Arcadia</i>; Sherlock's <i>Discourse on Death</i> passed through
forty editions; <i>The Fifteen Comforts</i>, a translation of a French
satirical work of the fifteenth century; Sir Richard Baker's
<i>Chronicle of the Kings of England from the time of the Romans'
Government unto the Death of King James</i> (1641); Mrs. Manley was
tried for libelling the nobility in her <i>Secret Memoirs and Manners
of several Persons of Quality of both Sexes from the New Atlantis</i>
(1707); the Fielding referred to is Beau Fielding, tried at the Old
Bailey in 1706 for a bigamous marriage with the Duchess of
Cleveland.</p>

given in the <i>Oxford English Dictionary</i> is an advertisement, June 12,
1742&mdash;'Proposals for erecting a Public Circulating Library in
London.' Joseph Knight, in the Oxford edition of Sheridan's
<i>Plays</i>, annotates this passage fully. Dillingham, sending his Latin
translation of Herbert's <i>Porch</i> to Sancroft, says: 'I know that if
these should be once published, it would be too late then to prevent,
if not to correct a fault; I therefore shall take it as a great kindness
if you will please to put on your critical naile, and to give your
impartial censure on these papers while they are yet in the tireing
roome; and I shall endeavour to amend them with one great or
more lesser blotts.' Sancroft replies: 'I greedily took your original
in one hand, and your copy in the other, of which I had suffered
one nayl (though it pretends not to be a critical one) to grow ever
since you bespoke its service.'</p>

<p>P. 216. <i>Brant.</i>&mdash;Sebastian Brant's <i>Narrenschiff</i>, published in
1497, at Basle, was the first printed book that treated of contemporaneous
events and living persons, instead of old German battles
and French knights. Barclay's translation, Professor Max Müller
points out, 'was not made from the original but from Locher's
Latin translation. It reproduces the matter, but not the marrow of
the original satire ... in some parts his translation is an improvement
on the original.' <i>The Ship of Fools</i> in its original form, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span>
in numerous translations, had an enormous success, edition after

the second edition of Ferriar's <i>Illustrations of Sterne, and other Essays</i>,
1812, with some 140 additional lines.</p>

<p>'He, whom chief the laughing Muses own' is Aristophanes; the
lines that follow refer to the fire of London. D&mdash;n=Dryden.</p>

<p>'On one of these occasions [a book-auction] a succession of valuable
fragments of early English poetry brought prices so high and
far beyond those of ordinary expensive books in the finest condition,
that it seemed as if their imperfections were their merit; and the
auctioneer, momentarily carried off with this feeling, when the high
prices began to sink a little, remonstrated thus, "Going so low as
thirty shillings, gentlemen,&mdash;this curious book&mdash;so low as thirty
shillings&mdash;and <i>quite imperfect</i>!"'&mdash;<span class="smcap">J. H. Burton.</span> <i>The Book-Hunter.</i></p>

<p>Ferriar mentions incidentally most of the famous printers of olden

1633. 'He had never learned to read; and yet he was perpetually
poring over the leaves of old books that were used in his master's
shop. A bookseller, who lived in the neighbourhood, and who had
often observed this, and knew the boy could not read, asked him
one day "what he meant by staring so much on printed paper?"
Magliabechi said that he did not know how it was, but that he
loved it of all things. The consequence was that he was received,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>
with tears of joy in his eyes, into the bookseller's shop; and hence
rose, by a quick succession, into posts of literary honour, till he
became librarian to the Grand Duke of Tuscany.'</p>

<p>P. 234. <i>Longfellow.</i>&mdash;Bayard Taylor, born 1825, died 1878. The
allusion is to the famous monument of the Emperor Maximilian in
the Franciscan church, or Hofkirche, at Innsbruck, where a kneeling
figure of Maximilian is surrounded by statues of his contemporaries
and ancestors. The emperor is buried actually at Wiener-Neustadt.
Taylor published <i>Prince Deukalion: a lyrical drama</i>, in 1878.</p>

<p>P. 239. <i>de Bury.</i>&mdash;J. H. Burton, in <i>The Book-Hunter</i>, tells the
following story:&mdash;It was Thomson, I believe, who used to cut the
leaves with his snuffers. Perhaps an event in his early career may
have soured him of the proprieties. It is said that he had an
uncle, a clever active mechanic, who could do many things with
his hands, and contemplated James's indolent, dreamy, 'feckless'
character with impatient disgust. When the first of <i>The Seasons</i>&mdash;<i>Winter</i>
it was, I believe&mdash;had been completed at press, Jamie
thought, by a presentation copy, to triumph over his uncle's scepticism,
and to propitiate his good opinion he had the book handsomely
bound. The old man never looked inside, or asked what
the book was about, but turning it round and round with his fingers
in gratified admiration, exclaimed: 'Come, is that really our
Jamie's doin' now? Weel, I never thought the cratur wad hae
had the handicraft to do the like!'</p>

the ample margin of one of its pages, where they were found long
after the poet's death.</p>

<p>P. 250. <i>Parnell.</i>&mdash;'It was supposed that a binding of Russian
leather secured books against insects, but the contrary was recently

<p>'Smith was very comical about a remedy of Lady Holland's for

<p>John Allen, M.D., was the librarian, described by Byron as 'the

the title of 'Lady Holland's atheist'.</p>

that, with her literary tastes, she should be delighted at hearing in
how magnificent a manner the greatest lady in the land encouraged
literature'. The conversation took place at Windsor in December,
1785.</p>

<p>P. 255. <i>Lamb.</i>&mdash;Walter Pater says of Charles Lamb: 'He was
a true "collector", delighting in the personal finding of a thing, in
the colour an old book or print gets for him by the little accidents
which attest previous ownership. Wither's <i>Emblems</i>, "that old
book and quaint," long-desired, when he finds it at last, he values
none the less because a child had coloured the plates with his paints.'</p>

<p>P. 256. <i>Milton.</i>&mdash;'The call for books was not in Milton's age
what it is in the present. To read was not then a general amusement;
neither traders, nor often gentlemen, thought themselves disgraced

was every house supplied with a closet of knowledge.'&mdash;<span class="smcap">Dr. Johnson.</span></p>

</div></div>

<p>P. 263. <i>Lewis.</i>&mdash;This is a portion of an imitation of Horace.
<i>Ep.</i> 20, Bk. i.</p>

<p>P. 265. <i>Gay.</i>&mdash;The authorship of this and the following poem
cannot be decided definitely, but it is presumed that they were
written by Gay and Pope respectively, and they have been so
credited in the text.</p>

<p>P. 269. <i>Lamb.</i>&mdash;This appeared originally in <i>The London Magazine</i>,
and was reprinted by Hone in <i>The Every-Day Book</i>. It was in
Hone's <i>Table Book</i> that Lamb's extracts from the Elizabethan
dramatists were published.</p>

<p>P. 269. <i>Goldsmith.</i>&mdash;See Bacon, on p. <a href="#Page_65">65</a>, and the note thereon.</p>

<p>P. 270. <i>Scott.</i>&mdash;Sir Walter was the first President of the Bannatyne
Club, and he wrote these lines for the anniversary dinner in
1823. The club had been founded in the previous year with the
object of printing works on the history and antiquities of Scotland.
Bannatyne himself, whose name was given to the club, achieved
immortality by copying out nearly all the ancient poetry of
Scotland in 1568, at a time when the country was ravaged by
plague, and the records of Scottish literature were also in danger of
destruction. Of the other names mentioned here, Ritson had written
a vegetarian book. The 'yeditur' was the name given by Lord
Eldon to James Sibbald. 'Greysteel' was a romance that David
Herd sought in vain, and it gave him his nickname.</p>

<p>P. 271. <i>Maginn.</i>&mdash;Sung at the Booksellers' Annual Dinner, Blackwall,
June 7, 1840. Fraser, whose name lives in his magazine, died
in the following year.</p>

<p>It is very tempting to give more passages about booksellers
but I must refrain as it would be foreign to the purpose of this
volume, and the subject has been recently treated with great fullness
and greater ability by Mr. Frank A. Mumby in <i>The Romance of
Bookselling</i>.</p>

<p>P. 273. <i>de Bury.</i>&mdash;'Would it not grieve a man of a good spirit
to see Hobson finde more money in the tayles of 12 jades than
a scholler in 200 bookes?'&mdash;<i>The Pilgrimage to Parnassus.</i> Hobson,
the carrier, celebrated by Milton, is the hero of 'Hobson's choice'.</p>

<p>P. 274. <i>Lamb.</i>&mdash;'The motto I proposed for the [<i>Edinburgh</i>]
<i>Review</i> was: Tenui Musam meditamur avena&mdash;"we cultivate literature
upon a little oatmeal."'&mdash;<span class="smcap">Sydney Smith.</span></p>

<p>P. 274. <i>Ruskin.</i>&mdash;Mark Pattison said that nobody who respected
himself could have less than 1,000 volumes, and that this number
of octavo volumes could be stacked in a bookcase 13 feet by 10 feet
and 6 inches deep. He complained that the bookseller's bill in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span>
ordinary middle-class family is shamefully small, and he thought it
monstrous that a man who is earning £1,000 a year should spend
less than £1 a week on books. 'A shilling in the pound to be spent
on books,' is Lord Morley's comment, 'by a clerk who earns
a couple of hundred pounds a year, or by a workman who earns a
quarter of that sum, is rather more, I think, than can be reasonably
expected.'</p>

<p>P. 276. <i>Lamb.</i>&mdash;Comberbatch was the name in which Coleridge
enlisted in the Dragoons. <i>The Life and Opinions of John Buncle,
Esq.</i>, was by Thomas Amory. Leigh Hunt describes Buncle as 'a
kind of innocent Henry VIII of private life'.</p>

<p>Charles Lamb, who at last grew tired of lending his books,
threatened to chain Wordsworth's poems to his shelves, adding:&mdash;'For
of those who borrow, some read slow; some mean to read,
but don't read; and some neither read nor mean to read, but
borrow to leave you an opinion of their sagacity. I must do my
money-borrowing friends the justice to say that there is nothing of
this caprice or wantonness of alienation in them. When they
borrow my money they never fail to make use of it.'&mdash;<span class="smcap">Sir T. N.
Talfourd.</span></p>

<p>P. 289. <i>Shakespeare.</i>&mdash;Also in a later scene of the same play:&mdash;'Thou
hast most traitorously corrupted the youth of the realm
in erecting a grammar-school; and whereas, before, our forefathers
had no other books but the score and the tally, thou hast
caused printing to be used; and, contrary to the king, his crown,
and dignity, thou hast built a paper-mill. It will be proved to thy
face that thou hast men about thee that usually talk of a noun and
a verb, and such abominable words as no Christian ear can endure
to hear.'</p>

<p>P. 292. <i>Wesley.</i>&mdash;'Next morning he was still better: ... he
desired to be drawn into the library, and placed by the central
window, that he might look down upon the Tweed. Here he expressed
a wish that I should read to him, and when I asked from
what book, he said&mdash;"Need you ask? There is but one."'&mdash;<span class="smcap">J.
G. Lockhart.</span> <i>Life of Sir Walter Scott.</i></p>

<p>'It is our <i>duty</i> to live among books, especially to live by <span class="smcap">ONE
BOOK</span>, and a very old one.'&mdash;<span class="smcap">John Henry Newman</span> in <i>Tracts for the
Times</i>.</p>

<p>P. 296. <i>De Vere.</i>&mdash;Addison speaks of Horace and Pindar as
showing, when confronted with the Psalms, 'an absurdity and confusion
of style,' and 'a comparative poverty of imagination'.</p>

<p>Coleridge has left on record his opinion that, 'after reading Isaiah
or St. Paul's Epistle to the Hebrews, Homer and Virgil are disgustingly
tame to me, and Milton himself scarcely tolerable.'</p>

<p>Milton's own words may be recalled: 'There are no songs comparable
to the songs of Sion; no orations equal to those of the
Prophets.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span></p>

<p>P. 296. <i>Swift.</i>&mdash;Compare Cowper in <i>Hope</i>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i7">In her own light arrayed,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">See mercy's grand apocalypse displayed!<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The sacred book no longer suffers wrong,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Bound in the fetters of an unknown tongue;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">But speaks with plainness, art could never mend,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">What simplest minds can soonest comprehend.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Macaulay described the Bible as 'a book which, if everything else
in our language should perish, would alone suffice to show the whole
extent of its beauty and power'.</p>

<p>P. 297. <i>Arnold.</i>&mdash;Wordsworth's opinion was that the prophetic
and lyrical parts of the Bible formed 'the great storehouse of
enthusiastic and meditative imagination'.</p>

<p>P. 297. <i>Faber.</i>&mdash;Professor Huxley wrote in the <i>Contemporary
Review</i>, in his famous article on 'The School Boards':&mdash;'Consider
the great historical fact that, for three centuries, this book has been
woven into the life of all that is best and noblest in English history;
that it has become the national epic of Britain, and is familiar to
noble and simple, from John-o'-Groat's House to Land's End, as
Dante and Tasso were once to the Italians; that it is written in the
noblest and purest English, and abounds in exquisite beauties of
mere literary form; and, finally, that it forbids the veriest hind
who never left his village to be ignorant of the existence of other
countries and other civilizations, and of a great past, stretching
back to the furthest limits of the oldest nations in the world.'</p>

<p>P. 299. <i>Eliot.</i>&mdash;Maggie Tulliver, during the home troubles
caused by her father's bankruptcy, receives a present of books,
among which is the <i>Imitation of Christ</i>.</p>

<p>P. 304. <i>Gaskell.</i>&mdash;The essay by Mrs. Gaskell, first published in
<i>Household Words</i> in 1854, was suggested by an article by Victor
Cousin on Madame de Sablé in the <i>Revue des Deux Mondes</i>. Madame
was a habitual guest at the Hôtel Rambouillet and friend of the
Duchess de Longueville; her crowning accomplishment was the
ability <i>tenir un salon</i>.</p>

<p>P. 311. <i>Alcuin.</i>&mdash;Born at York in 735, Alcuin was the adviser of
Charlemagne, whose court, under the Englishman's direction became
a centre of culture. After fifteen years of court life at Aix-la-Chapelle
Alcuin retired to Tours, where he died in 804. His English name is
given as Ealwhine.</p>

<p>The catalogue refers to the library of Egbert, Archbishop of York.
The translator is D. McNicoll.</p>

<p>P. 311. <i>King.</i>&mdash;This is an extract from a poem of 1,500 lines
preserved in vol. iii of Nichols's <i>Poems</i>, where it is said to be probably
by Dr. W. King. It first appeared in 1712. See p. 252.</p>

<p>P. 313. <i>Pope.</i>&mdash;For the fate of the bonfire the reader is referred
to the <i>Dunciad</i> itself. Pope explains that 'this library is divided
into three parts; the first consists of those authors from whom he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span>
(the hero, i.e. Colley Cibber) stole, and whose works he mangled;
the second, of such as fitted the shelves, or were gilded for show, or
adorned with pictures; the third class our author calls solid learning,
old Bodies of Divinity, old Commentaries, old English Printers,
or old English Translations; all very voluminous, and fit to erect
altars to Dulness'. Tibbald, or Theobald, wrote <i>Shakespear Restored</i>;
Ogilby, poet and printer, is mentioned by Addison on p. 210; the
Duchess of Newcastle was responsible for eight folios of poetical and
philosophical works; Settle, the hero's brother Laureate 'for the city
instead of the court'; Banks, his rival in tragedy; Broome, 'a serving
man of Ben Jonson'; De Lyra or Harpsfield, whose five volumes of
commentaries in folio were printed in 1472; Philemon Holland, 'the
translator general of his age'; Cibber's Birthday Ode as Laureate.</p>

<p>William Caxton (1422-91), of course, printed, at Bruges, the first
book printed in English&mdash;the <i>Recuyell of the Historyes of Troye</i>&mdash;in
1474. His printing press in Westminster was set up two years later.
Wynkyn de Worde, his servant and successor, started business on
his own account in 1491.</p>

<p>P. 314. <i>Sterne.</i>&mdash;'Sterne has generally concealed the sources of
his curious trains of investigation, and uncommon opinions, but in
one instance he ventured to break through his restraint by
mentioning Bouchet's <i>Evening Conferences</i>, among the treasures of
Mr. Shandy's library.... I have great reason to believe that it was
in the Skelton library some years ago, where I suspect Sterne found
most of the authors of this class. I entertain little doubt, that from
the perusal of this work, Sterne conceived the first precise idea of
his <i>Tristram</i>, as far as anything can be called precise, in a desultory
book, apparently written with great rapidity.'</p>

<p>This quotation is from Ferriar's <i>Illustrations of Sterne</i>, which was
published in 1798. He seemed, Sir Walter Scott wrote, 'born to
trace and detect the various mazes through which Sterne carried
on his depredations upon ancient and dusty authors.' Ferriar wrote
the following lines addressed to Sterne:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">Sterne, for whose sake I plod through miry ways,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Of antique wit and quibbling mazes drear,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Let not thy shade malignant censure fear,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Though aught of borrowed mirth my search betrays.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Long slept that mirth in dust of ancient days,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">(Erewhile to Guise or wanton Valois dear;)<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Till waked by thee in Skelton's joyous pile,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">She flung on Tristram her capricious rays;<br /></span>
<span class="i3">But the quick tear that checks our wondering smile,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">In sudden pause or unexpected story,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Owns thy true mastery&mdash;and Le Fever's woes,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Maria's wanderings, and the Prisoner's throes,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Fix thee conspicuous on the throne of glory.<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span></div></div>

<p>P. 315. <i>Scott.</i>&mdash;The modern poet is Crabbe, and the context will
be found on p. <a href="#Page_340">340</a>; Thalaba is the name of Southey's hero.</p>

<p>P. 319. <i>Montaigne.</i>&mdash;In another essay Montaigne tells us that his
library for a country library could pass for a very fair one.</p>

<p>P. 320. <i>Southey.</i>&mdash;This extract is from Southey's <i>Sir Thomas
More</i>; a book of colloquies between Southey himself, under the name
of Montesinos, and the apparition of Sir T. More: who tells him
that 'it is your lot, as it was mine, to live during one of the grand
climacterics of the world', and that, 'I come to you, rather than to
any other person, because you have been led to meditate upon the
corresponding changes whereby your age and mine are distinguished,
and because ... there are certain points of sympathy and resemblance
which bring us into contact.' The colloquies are upon such
subjects as the feudal and manufacturing systems, the Reformation,
prospects of Europe, infidelity, trade.</p>

<p>Chartier was the French poet whose 'eternal glory' it was 'to
have announced the mission of Jeanne d'Arc'.</p>

<p>'Here are God's conduits,' &amp;c., is from the first of Donne's <i>Satires</i>.</p>

<p>P. 324. <i>Barton.</i>&mdash;The Rev. John Mitford (1781-1859) formed
a large library at Benham, where he also devoted himself to gardening.</p>

<p>P. 325. <i>Bale.</i>&mdash;'I was called to London to wait upon the Duke
of Norfolk, who having at my sole request bestowed the Arundelian
Library on the Royal Society, sent to me to take charge of the
books and remove them.... I procured for our Society, besides
printed books, near 100 MSS., some in Greek, of great concernment.
The printed books being of the oldest impressions are not the less
valuable; I esteem them almost equal to MSS. Amongst them are
most of the Fathers printed at Basle, before the Jesuits abused
them with their expurgatory Indexes; there is a noble MS. of
Vitruvius. Many of these books had been presented by Popes,
Cardinals, and great persons, to the Earls of Arundel and Dukes of
Norfolk; and the late magnificent Earl of Arundel bought a noble
library in Germany, which is in this collection. I should not, for
the honour I bear the family, have persuaded the Duke to part with
these, had I not seen how negligent he was of them, suffering the
priests and everybody to carry away and dispose of what they
pleased, so that abundance of rare things are irrecoverably gone.'&mdash;<span class="smcap">J.
Evelyn</span> (<i>Diary</i>, August 29, 1678.)</p>

<p>P. 326. <i>Whittier.</i>&mdash;Sung at the opening of the library at Haverhill,
Mass.</p>

<p>P. 334. <i>Helps.</i>&mdash;Pope's <i>Essay on Man</i>:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">If parts allure thee, think how Bacon shined,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The wisest, brightest, meanest of mankind.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The other allusions are to Johnson, Byron, Shelley, and Keats.</p>

<p>P. 337. <i>Crabbe.</i>&mdash;It is explained by Crabbe that while composing
'The Library' he 'was honoured with the notice and assisted by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span>
the advice of the Right Honourable Edmund Burke: part of it
was written in his presence, and the whole submitted to his judgement;
receiving, in its progress, the benefit of his correction'. The
poem was published in 1781.</p>

<p>P. 354. <i>Saxe.</i>&mdash;Aristophanes' <i>The Clouds</i>, ridiculing Socrates.</p>

<p>P. 355. <i>Drummond.</i>&mdash;Of Sir Thomas Bodley old Anthony Wood
says: 'Though no writer, worth the remembrance, yet hath he
been the greatest promoter of learning that hath yet appeared in
our nation.'</p>

<p>It may be recalled that R. de Bury had a fine idea, although it
did not fructify, to wit:&mdash;'We have for a long time held a rooted
purpose in the inmost recesses of our mind, looking forward to
a favourable time and divine aid, to found, in perpetual alms, and
enrich with the necessary gifts, a certain Hall in the revered University
of Oxford, the first nurse of all the liberal Arts; and further
to enrich the same, when occupied by numerous scholars, with
deposits of our books, so that the books themselves and every one
of them may be made common as to use and study, not only to
the scholars of the said Hall, but through them to all the students
of the aforesaid University for ever.'</p>

<p>P. 357. <i>Cowper.</i>&mdash;'This ode,' Cowper states, 'is rendered without
rhime, that it might more adequately represent the original, which,
as Milton himself informs us, is of no certain measure. It may
possibly for this reason disappoint the reader, though it cost the
writer more labour than the translation of any other piece in the
whole collection.'</p>

<p>P. 360. <i>Cowley.</i>&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">Who now reads Cowley? if he pleases yet,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">His moral pleases, not his pointed wit.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Forgot his epic, nay, Pindaric art!<br /></span>
<span class="i1">But still I love the language of his heart.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Pope.</span><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>P. 368. <i>J. M.</i>&mdash;It cannot escape observation that Bodley and his
library has been a much more fruitful theme than the University of
Cambridge. This is the only poem on the latter subject which I have
been able to find; it is quoted in Edwards's <i>Memoirs of Libraries</i>.
Leigh Hunt has related his experiences in the library of Trinity
College 'when the keeper of it was from home'; see p. 279.</p>

<p>P. 368. <i>Whitelocke.</i>&mdash;The authorship of this fine testimony is
attributed to Whitelocke, but I have not traced it, by J. K. Hoyt
and Anna L. Ward.</p>
